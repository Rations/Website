	<hr>
		<p>Many students consider these equations for 1-D motion under <em>constant</em> acceleration to be some of the simplest in mechanics; equally many can never quite remember them. They are actually not difficult to memorize if one understands their origins in calculus, which will be our goal here.</p>
		<p>For aesthetic purposes, when I write the function \(v\), I really mean \(v(t)\). Let's also agree that writing \(v_0\) is the same as writing \(v(0)\) and that \(t_0 = 0\).</p>
		<p>Then, given a constant acceleration \(a\):</p>
		<ol>
			<li>$$v = \int_{0}^{t}adt = a\left(\left.t \right|_0^t\right) = at + c_1$$

	<hr>
	<p><em>Note: this is an unrigorous proof.</em></p>
	<p>Let's assume our object is in perfect uniform circular motion—its speed is constant—for one whole rotation along a circle of radius \(r\). This assumption means that over one period \(T\), the magnitude of the object's average acceleration \(a\) will be equal to that of the object's instantaneous acceleration \(a_\text{rad}\) at any given moment within \(T\).</p>
	<p>Using geometry and the definition of velocity, we can find the period \(T\) in terms of \(v\) and \(r\):<p>
		\begin{align}
		v &= \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} \\
		\Delta t &= \frac{\Delta x}{v} = \frac{2\pi r}{v} \\
		\end{align}
		<p>Remember that we are dealing with vectors, which have direction. After one period, the object's velocity vector has completed one full rotation, or \(2\pi\). Thus:</p>
		\begin{align}
		a &= \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} \\
		&= \frac{2\pi v}{\frac{2\pi r}{v}} \\

	<summary>\(I_A = I_{CM} + md^2\): The parallel axis theorem</summary>
	<hr>
			<p>By definition, we know the moment of inertia about the center of mass of an object is:</p>
			$$I_{\text{CM}} = \int dm{\boldsymbol{r_0}}^2$$
			<p>But what if you wanted to rotate the object not about the center of mass, but some other point?</p>
			<p>In high-school physics, you learn to apply the parallel axis theorem in such cases. Chances are, your teacher skipped the derivation. Even if you know the parallel axis theorem by heart, you may want to follow along to remind yourself why it is valid for not only generic, nice-looking mass distributions, but also weird-looking non-uniform mass distributions. To start, considering the following (arbitrarily shaped) object.</p>
			<img class = "diagram" src = "PAT.svg"/>
			<p>\(CM\) is the object's center of mass. Now, we wish to find the moment of inertia about a new point, \(C\). Let's indicate the distance between \(CM\) and \(C\) using the position vector \(\textbf{d}\).</p>
			<p>Now consider a generic point—any point, really—on the object, and call it \(P\). If the distance from \(CM\) to \(P\) can be represented by the position vector \(\textbf{r}_0}\), then by vector geometry, the distance from the new center \(C\) to \(P\) is \(\boldsymbol{r_0} - \boldsymbol{d}\). This will hold true for each point \(P\) in the object.</p>
			<p>So, from the definition of moment of inertia, we have:</p>
			\begin{align}
			I_C &= \int dm(\boldsymbol{r_0} - \boldsymbol{d})^2 \\
			&= \int dm(\boldsymbol{r_0}^2 - 2\boldsymbol{r_0d} + \boldsymbol{d}^2) \\
			&= \int dm\boldsymbol{r_0}^2 - \int 2\boldsymbol{r_0d}dm + \int dm\boldsymbol{d}^2 \\
			\end{align}

			<p>The first term in our expression is simply the moment of inertia about the center of mass: \(I_{CM} = \int dm\boldsymbol{r}^2\)! ✓</p>
			<p>Since the center of mass is like a weighted average of the positions of all the small mass elements (\(dm\)), adding together all the \(dmr_0\)s should equal zero (remember, we are dealing with vectors, and there are little \(dm\)s on all sides of the \(CM\). Thus, the second term disappears. ✓</p>
			<p>In the third term, summing all the \(dm\)s returns the total mass of the object. ✓</p>

	<summary>\(I_{CM}\) of a uniform rod</summary>
	<hr>
	<p>Since our rod is uniform, its mass-length ("linear") density is the same at every point along its length: \(\lambda = \frac ML\). Using this info, we can find the mass element \(dm\) of every small length of rod \(dr\):</p>
			$$dm = \lambda dr = \frac{M}{L}dr$$
	<p>It's just integration from there. We are finding the moment of inertia about the rod's center, so half the rod lies in the positive direction and half the rod lies in the negative direction. Thus:</p>
			\begin{align}
			I &= \int dmr^2 \\
			&= \int_{-L/2}^{L/2} \frac{M}{L}dr r^2 \\
			&= \frac{M}{L}\left(\left.\frac{r^3}{3}\right|_{-L/2}^{L/2}\right) \\\

	<summary>\(I_{CM}\) of a uniform disk</summary>
	<hr>
			<p>A disk is like a slice of onion—a bunch of concentric rings placed neatly together. For each of these rings, if \(r\) is the radius, then the circumference is \(2\pi r\) and the area \(dA\) is \(2\pi rdr\) (remember, we are dealing with rings, not circles).</p>
			$$I = \int dmr^2$$
			<p>We need to find \(dm\). If the entire disk has uniform mass \(M\) and radius \(R\), its area density, or how much mass is "spread" across a given area, is:</p>
			$$\rho = \frac MA = \frac{M}{\pi R^2}$$
			<p>Meaning each of our concentric rings has mass:</p>
			$$dm = \rho dA = \frac{M}{\pi R^2}2\pi rdr = \frac{2Mrdr}{R^2}$$
			<p>Now we substitute \(dm\) into our equation for \(I\) and integrate from the smallest ring (\(r = 0\)) to the largest (\(r = R\)):</p>
			\begin{align}
			I &= \int_0^R \frac{2M}{R^2}r^3dr \\
			&= \frac{2M}{R^2}\left(\left.\frac{r^4}{4}\right|_0^R\right) \\

	<summary>\(I_{CM}\) of a uniform solid sphere</summary>
	<hr>
			<p>Imagine a spherical watermelon of radius \(R\) and uniform mass \(M\) centered at the origin. Cut it into thin circular slices—each resembles a thin disk! This suggests that we can use the moment of inertia of a disk about an axis through its center, \(I = \frac{1}{2}mr^2\), to find the watermelon's moment of inertia:</p>
			$$I = \int_{-R}^{R} \frac{1}{2}dmr^2$$ 
			<p>First, the radius \(r\) of each slice depends on the position of the slice along the \(x\)-axis. From triangle geometry, we see that:</p>
			$$x^2 + r^2 = R^2$$
			$$r = \sqrt{R^2 - x^2}$$
			<p>Next, let's find \(dm\). Actually, the mass of each infinitesimal piece of watermelon is dependent on the volume \(dV\) . . . which is dependent on the area \(dA\) . . .  which is dependent on the radius \(r\) . . . which is dependent on \(x\)!</p>
			<p>We need the volumetric mass density of the watermelon, or how much mass is spread throughout a given volume. Since our watermelon is uniform, the density at any space within it is \(\rho = \frac{M}{\frac{4}{3}\pi R^3} = \frac{3M}{4\pi R^3}\).</p>
			<p>Now, for some quick substitutions:</p>
			\begin{align}
			dm &= \rho dV \\
			&= \rho(dAdx) \\
			&= \rho\left(\pi r^2dx\right) \\
			&= \rho\left(\pi \left(\sqrt{R^2 - x^2}\right)^2dx\right) \\
			&= \left(\frac{3M}{4 R^3}\right)\left(R^2 - x^2\right)dx \\
			\end{align}
			<p>At last, we can integrate from \(x = -R\) (one end of the watermelon) to \(x = R\) (the other end)!</p>
			\begin{align}
			I &= \int_{-R}^{R}\frac{1}{2}dmr^2 \\
			&= \int_{-R}^{R}\frac{1}{2}\left[\left(\frac{3M}{4 R^3}\right)\left(R^2 - x^2\right)dx\right] \left(R^2 - x^2\right) \\
			&= \frac{3M}{8R^3} \int_{-R}^{R} (R^2 - x^2)^2dx \\
			\end{align}
			<p>Expanding the stuff in the integral, we have:</p>
			\begin{align}
			&= \frac{3M}{8R^3} \left(\int_{-R}^{R}R^4dx - \int_{-R}^{R}2R^2x^2dx + \int_{-R}^{R}x^4dx\right) \\
			&= \frac{3M}{8R^3} \left(R^4\left(\left.x\right|_{-R}^{R}\right) - 2R^2\left(\left.\frac{x^3}{3}\right|_{-R}^{R}\right) + \left.\frac{x^5}{5}\right|_{-R}^{R}\right) \\

	<summary>"Reversal" of relative velocity in elastic collisions</summary>
	<hr>
			<p>Given two masses—\(m\) and \(M\) with initial velocities \(v_0\) and \(V_0\), respectively—we have from conservation of momentum and energy:</p>
			$$mv_0 + MV_0 = mv + MV$$
			$$\frac{1}{2}m{v_0}^2 + \frac{1}{2}M{V_0}^2 = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 + \frac{1}{2}MV^2$$
			<p>Rearranging the first equation, we find:</p>
			$$\frac{m}{M} = \frac{V - V_0}{v_0 - v}$$
			<p>Simplifying and rearranging the second euqation in the same manner, we find:</p>
			$$\frac{m}{M} = \frac{V^2 - {V_0}^2}{{v_0}^2 - v^2}$$
			<p>Setting the two equal, we have:</p>
			$$\frac{V - V_0}{v_0 - v} = \frac{V^2 - {V_0}^2}{{v_0}^2 - v^2}$$
			<p>Recognizing that \(a^2 - b^2 = (a + b)(a - b)\):</p>
			\begin{align}
			\frac{V - V_0}{v_0 - v} &= \frac{(V + V_0)(V - V_0)}{(v_0 + v)(v_0 - v)} \\

	<summary>\(\sin\theta \approx \theta\) and other small-angle approximations</summary>
	<hr>
			<p>A useful trick that can be applied in many derivations is small-angle approximation. It is easiest for sine:</p>
			$$\sin\theta = \frac{h}{r}$$
			<p>From geometry, we can see that the arc length swept by \(\theta\) is only slightly longer than \(h\) and the hypotenuse \(h\) is only slightly longer than the radius \(r\). If \(\theta\) is very small, they will be almost exactly the same. Substituting \(s\) in place of \(o\) and \(r\) in place of \(h\) leads us to . . . wait! \(\frac{s}{r}\) is just the definition of an angle in radians! So:</p>
			$$\sin\theta = \frac{o}{h} \approx \frac{s}{r} = \theta$$
			<div class = "answer">$$\sin\theta \approx \theta$$</div>
			<p>We can get a better sense of how valid this approximiation is by finding the percent error.</p>
			$$\text{% error} = \frac{\theta - \sin\theta}{\sin\theta} \times 100$$
			$$= 1 \text{ if }\theta = 0.244$$
			<p>So we won't even be one percent off as long as our angle is less than 0.244 radians, or 14 degrees!</p>
			<p>There are several ways to derive the corresponding approximiation for cosine (involving various expansions, Taylor series), but one method that leads to the same results involves using our result for sine. Recalling that:</p>
			\begin{align}
			\cos\left(2\theta\right) &= \cos^2\theta - \sin^2\theta \\
			\cos\theta &= \cos^2\left(\frac \theta 2\right) - \sin^2\left(\frac \theta 2\right) \\
			&= 1 - 2\sin^2\left(\frac \theta 2\right) \\
			&\approx 1 - 2\left(\frac \theta 2\right)^2\\
			\end{align}
			<div class = "answer">$$\cos\theta \approx 1 - \frac{\theta^2}{2}$$</div>
			<p>You might think that, to find the small angle approximation for tangent, you would divide our approximations for sine and cosine. Actually, we arrive much more quickly at a much neater solution by reexamining the same triangle we examined for sine:</p>
			$$\tan\theta = \frac{o}{r}$$
			<p>When \(\theta\) is small, we can substitute \(s\) in place of \(o\). It follows that:</p>
			$$\tan\theta = \frac{o}{r} \approx \frac{s}{r} = \theta$$

	<summary>\(\omega\) and \(T\) for simple harmonic motion</summary>
	<hr>
			<h4>Regular vs. angular frequency</h4>
			<hr>
			<p>Frequency describes how many cycles something completes in a unit of time (\(\frac{1}{\text{s}}\) or \(\text{hz}\) in SI units).</p>
			<p>Angular frequency is an extension of this concept: it is the angle something covers in a unit of time. "Covers" can mean the angle swept by object spinning in a circle (rotating) or the fraction of a cycle a periodic function, like a sine wave, completes in that time.</p>
			<p>More precisely, it can be written as \(\frac{2\pi}{T}\), where \(T\) is the period of the motion. For circles, \(2\pi\) is one complete revolution (kind of like a cycle). For periodic functions, it is the time the function spends doing something before it repeats itself.</p>
			<h4>Angular frequency and simple harmonic motion</h4>
			<hr>
			<p>We know that an object in simple harmonic motion, like one on the end of a spring, oscillates. Its position can be represented by a sinusoidal function, meaning it is periodic and thus has angular frequency.</p>
			<p>To derive the angular frequency of an object in SHS, we first have to recognize that an object attached to a spring experiences a force \(F = -kx\), for the spring force is always in the direction opposite to the object's displacement relative to its equilibrium position.</p>

			<p>We know that smart people have solved the second-order differential equations to find that an object in SHS's position can be modeled by an equation of the form:</p>
			$$x = B\sin(\omega t) + A\cos(\omega t)$$
			<p>The unknowns in this equation depend on the initial conditions of the system. Let's construct our coordinate system such that the equilibrium position is at the origin. Let's also say that at \(t = 0\), we release the spring from a given amplitude \(A\), thus beginning its oscillation.</p>
			<p>\(\sin0 = 0\), which simplifies things nicely. From differentiation:</p>
			\begin{align} 
			x &= A\cos(\omega t) \\
			v &= -A\omega\sin (\omega t) \\
			a &= -A\omega^2 \cos(\omega t) \\
			\end{align}
			<p>Now that we have expressions for \(x\) and \(a\) in terms of \(t\), we can substitute these into our original force equation and discover new relationships.</p>
			$$m(-B\omega^2 \cos(\omega t)) = -k(B\cos(\omega t))$$
			<div class = "answer">$$\omega = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}$$</div>
			<p>So the angular frequency of an object oscillating at the end of a spring is dependent solely on the spring constant \(k\) and its own mass \(m\), <em>not</em> the amplitude.</p>
			<p>And since \(\omega = \frac{2\pi}{T}\), we can solve for \(T\):</p>

	<summary>\({n \choose k}p^k\left(1 - p\right)^{n - k}\): Binomial probability</summary>
	<hr>
			<p>We use binomial probability to find the probability that one of two events (with probabilities \(p\) and \(1 - p\), respectively) will occur exactly \(k\) times when \(n\) trials are performed. The formula seems a little arcane, but it's not too hard to understand intuitively. Note that the probability from trial to trial must remain unchanged.</p>
			<p>The standard example is flipping a coin multiple times. Say you wanted to find the probability that, given 10 flips, exactly 5 would be heads. There are clearly many ways this could happen—you could flip five heads then five tails; five tails then five heads; two heads, five tails, then 3 heads; etc.—but the probability of each scenario happening is the same, since the trials are independent. To find the probability of any given sequence, you will be multiplying a bunch of 0.5s together.</p>
			<p>Given \(n\) coins and \(k\) heads, there will be \(n - k\) tails. The total number of unique sequences in which you can flip five heads and five tails is thus \(n \choose k\).</p>
			<p>Imagine ten slots in a line representing one possible outcome. From these ten, you want to choose five in which a head should appear<sup>1</sup>.</p>
			<p>If \(p\) is the probability of flipping a head, then \(1 - p\) is the probability of flipping a tail, as we have only two events possible.</p>
			<p>The total probability is thus the product of the number of "good" sequences and the probability of each individual sequence happening.</p>
