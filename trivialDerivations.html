			<h3>\(g = 9.8 \text{ m}/\text{s}^2\)</h3>
			<div>
				<p>Newton's law of universal gravitation models the attractive force between two masses a distance \(r\) apart as</p>
				$$F_g = G\frac{m_1m_2}{r^2}$$
				<p>Big \(G\) is a constant that must be found experimentally, but once you know it, you can easily calculate little \(g\) thanks to Newton's second law. For instance, a mass \(m\) falling near the Earth's surface<sup>[1]</sup> is acted upon by</p>
				\begin{align}
					F = ma &= G\frac{mm_\text{Earth}}{{r_\text{Earth}}^2} \\

			<h3>\(x = x_0 + v_0t + \frac{1}{2}at^2\) and others</h3>
			<div>
				<p>You might have trouble remembering the following equations for 1-D uniform-acceleration motion. Memorizing them is actually not so hard if you understand their calculus-based derivations.</p>
				<p>Given a constant acceleration \(a\),</p>
				\begin{align}

				<p>The initial velocity is \(v_0 = c_1\). For aesthetic reasons, let's also say that writing \(t_f\) is equivalent to writing any generic end time \(t\). Our final equation then looks like</p>
				<div class = "answer">$$v = v_0 + at$$</div>
				<p>Integrating this expression with respect to time leaves us with displacement.</p>

			<h3>\(a_\text{rad} = \frac{v^2}{r}\)</h3>
			<div>
				<p><em>This is a fairly unrigorous proof that can only be applied to uniform circular motion.</em></p>
				<p>Imagine an object that travels at a constant speed in a circle of radius \(r\) for exactly one rotation. By definition, it takes the object one period \(T\) of time to complete one rotation. Because the object's speed is constant, its average acceleration over \(T\) will be equal to its instantaneous acceleration \(a\) at any given moment within \(T\).</p>
				<p>Using geometry and the definition of velocity, we can find the period \(T\) in terms of \(v\) and \(r\):<p>
				\begin{align}
					v &= \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} \\
					\Delta t &= \frac{\Delta x}{v} = \frac{2\pi r}{v} \\
				\end{align}
				<p>Remember that we are dealing with vectors, which have direction. After one period, the object's velocity vector has completed one full rotation, or \(2\pi\). Thus:</p>
				\begin{align}
					a &= \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} \\
					&= \frac{2\pi v}{\frac{2\pi r}{v}} \\

					<h3>\(I_A = I_{CM} + md^2\): parallel axis theorem</h3>
					<div>
						<p>By definition, we know the moment of inertia about the center of mass of an object is:</p>
						$$I_{\text{CM}} = \int dm{\boldsymbol{r_0}}^2$$
						<p>But what if you wanted to rotate the object not about the center of mass, but some other point?</p>
						<p>In high-school physics, you learn to apply the parallel axis theorem in such cases. Chances are, your teacher skipped the derivation. Even if you know the parallel axis theorem by heart, you may want to follow along to remind yourself why it is valid for not only generic, nice-looking mass distributions, but also weird-looking non-uniform mass distributions. To start, considering the following (arbitrarily shaped) object.</p>
						<img class = "diagram" src = "PAT.svg"/>
						<p>\(CM\) is the object's center of mass. Now, we wish to find the moment of inertia about a new point, \(C\). Let's indicate the distance between \(CM\) and \(C\) using the position vector \(\textbf{d}\).</p>
						<p>Now consider a generic point—any point, really—on the object, and call it \(P\). If the distance from \(CM\) to \(P\) can be represented by the position vector \(\textbf{r}_0}\), then by vector geometry, the distance from the new center \(C\) to \(P\) is \(\boldsymbol{r_0} - \boldsymbol{d}\). This will hold true for each point \(P\) in the object.</p>
						<p>So, from the definition of moment of inertia, we have:</p>
						\begin{align}
						I_C &= \int dm(\boldsymbol{r_0} - \boldsymbol{d})^2 \\
						&= \int dm(\boldsymbol{r_0}^2 - 2\boldsymbol{r_0d} + \boldsymbol{d}^2) \\
						&= \int dm\boldsymbol{r_0}^2 - \int 2\boldsymbol{r_0d}dm + \int dm\boldsymbol{d}^2 \\
						\end{align}

						<p>The first term in our expression is simply the moment of inertia about the center of mass: \(I_{CM} = \int dm\boldsymbol{r}^2\)! ✓</p>
						<p>Since the center of mass is like a weighted average of the positions of all the small mass elements (\(dm\)), adding together all the \(dmr_0\)s should equal zero (remember, we are dealing with vectors, and there are little \(dm\)s on all sides of the \(CM\). Thus, the second term disappears. ✓</p>
						<p>In the third term, summing all the \(dm\)s returns the total mass of the object. ✓</p>
						<div class = "answer">$$I_\text{C} = I_\text{CM} + md^2$$</div>

					<h3>\(I_{CM}\) of a uniform rod</h3>
					<div>
						<img class = "diagram_m" src = "PAT 1.svg"/>
						<p>A uniform rod of mass \(M\) and length \(L\) has a mass-length density of \(\lambda = \frac{M}{L}\) at every point. A small section of this rod with length \(dr\) thus has mass</p>
						$$dm = \lambda dr = \frac{M}{L}dr$$
						<p>It's just integration from there. We are finding the moment of inertia about the rod's center, so half the rod lies in the positive direction and half the rod lies in the negative direction. Thus:</p>
						\begin{align}
						I &= \int dmr^2 \\
						&= \int_{-L/2}^{L/2} \frac{M}{L}dr r^2 \\
						&= \frac{M}{L}\left(\left.\frac{r^3}{3}\right|_{-L/2}^{L/2}\right) \\\
						\end{align}
						<div class = "answer">$$I = \frac{1}{12}ML^2$$</div>
					</div>
					<h3>\(I\) of a uniform disk</h3>
					<div>
						<p>A disk is like a slice of onion—a bunch of concentric rings placed neatly together. For each of these rings, if \(r\) is the radius, then the circumference is \(2\pi r\) and the area \(dA\) is \(2\pi rdr\) (remember, we are dealing with rings, not circles).</p>
						<img class = "diagram_m" src = "PAT 2.svg"/>
						$$I = \int dmr^2$$
						<p>We need to find \(dm\). If the entire disk has uniform mass \(M\) and radius \(R\), its area density, or how much mass is "spread" across a given area, is:</p>
						$$\rho = \frac MA = \frac{M}{\pi R^2}$$
						<p>Meaning each of our concentric rings has mass:</p>
						$$dm = \rho dA = \frac{M}{\pi R^2}2\pi rdr = \frac{2Mrdr}{R^2}$$
						<p>Now we substitute \(dm\) into our equation for \(I\) and integrate from the smallest ring (\(r = 0\)) to the largest (\(r = R\)):</p>
						\begin{align}
						I &= \int_0^R \frac{2M}{R^2}r^3dr \\
						&= \frac{2M}{R^2}\left(\left.\frac{r^4}{4}\right|_0^R\right) \\
						\end{align}
						<div class = "answer">$$I = \frac{1}{2}MR^2$$</div>
					</div>
					<h3>\(I_{CM}\) of a uniform solid sphere</h3>
					<div>
						<p>Imagine a spherical watermelon of radius \(R\) and uniform mass \(M\) centered at the origin. Cut it into thin circular slices—each resembles a thin disk! This suggests that we can use the moment of inertia of a disk about an axis through its center, \(I = \frac{1}{2}mr^2\), to find the watermelon's moment of inertia:</p>
						$$I = \int_{-R}^{R} \frac{1}{2}dmr^2$$ 
						<p>First, the radius \(r\) of each slice depends on the position of the slice along the \(x\)-axis. From triangle geometry, we see that:</p>
						$$x^2 + r^2 = R^2$$
						$$r = \sqrt{R^2 - x^2}$$
						<p>Next, let's find \(dm\). Actually, the mass of each infinitesimal piece of watermelon is dependent on the volume \(dV\) . . . which is dependent on the area \(dA\) . . .  which is dependent on the radius \(r\) . . . which is dependent on \(x\)!</p>
						<p>We need the volumetric mass density of the watermelon, or how much mass is spread throughout a given volume. Since our watermelon is uniform, the density at any space within it is \(\rho = \frac{M}{\frac{4}{3}\pi R^3} = \frac{3M}{4\pi R^3}\).</p>
						<p>Now, for some quick substitutions:</p>
						\begin{align}
						dm &= \rho dV \\
						&= \rho(dAdx) \\
						&= \rho\left(\pi r^2dx\right) \\
						&= \rho\left(\pi \left(\sqrt{R^2 - x^2}\right)^2dx\right) \\
						&= \left(\frac{3M}{4 R^3}\right)\left(R^2 - x^2\right)dx \\
						\end{align}
						<p>At last, we can integrate from \(x = -R\) (one end of the watermelon) to \(x = R\) (the other end)!</p>
						\begin{align}
						I &= \int_{-R}^{R}\frac{1}{2}dmr^2 \\
						&= \int_{-R}^{R}\frac{1}{2}\left[\left(\frac{3M}{4 R^3}\right)\left(R^2 - x^2\right)dx\right] \left(R^2 - x^2\right) \\
						&= \frac{3M}{8R^3} \int_{-R}^{R} \left(R^2 - x^2\right)^2dx \\
						\end{align}
						<p>Expanding the stuff in the integral, we have:</p>
						\begin{align}
						&= \frac{3M}{8R^3} \left(\int_{-R}^{R}R^4dx - \int_{-R}^{R}2R^2x^2dx + \int_{-R}^{R}x^4dx\right) \\
						&= \frac{3M}{8R^3} \left(R^4\left(\left.x\right|_{-R}^{R}\right) - 2R^2\left(\left.\frac{x^3}{3}\right|_{-R}^{R}\right) + \left.\frac{x^5}{5}\right|_{-R}^{R}\right) \\
						\end{align}
						<div class = "answer">$$I = \frac{2}{5}MR^2$$</div>
					</div>
					<h3>\(I_{CM}\) of a thin spherical shell</h3>
					<div>
						<p>A very elegant way to find this moment of inertia is through using the moment of inertia of a solid sphere (see previous derivation). The basic intuition is, how much will the moment of inertia of our sphere change if we increase the radius by a very, very small amount? That change will be the moment of inertia of our thin spherical shell.</p>
						<p>Since we're talking about microscopic amounts of change, differentiation is a good bet. But first, we need to adjust our moment of inertia expression for the solid sphere a bit.</p>
						$$I_{CM} = \frac{2}{5}MR^2$$
						<p>We'd like to find the change in \(I\) per change in \(R\), so we should differentiate with respect to \(R\). But things become rather nasty, because both \(M\) and \(I\) are dependent on \(R\). Our job would be alot easier if we could express the moment of inertia with a constant instead of \(M\).</p>
						<p>We have from the previous derivation that the (constant) mass-volume density of a solid sphere is \(\rho = \frac{M}{\frac{4}{3}\pi R^3}\). Our sphere has a volume of \(\frac{4}{3}\pi R^3\). Therefore, we can rewrite \(\frac{2}{5}MR^2\) as</p>
						\begin{align}
						I_{CM} &= \frac{2}{5}\rho\frac{4}{3}\pi R^3R^2 \\
						&= \frac{8}{15}\pi\rho R^5 \\
						\end{align}
						<p>Now we can easily differentiate with respect to \(R\).</p>
						\begin{align}
						dI &= \frac{8}{15}\pi\rho 5R^4dr \\
						\end{align}
						<div class = "answer">$$I = \frac{2}{3}MR^2$$</div>
					</div>
					<h3>"Reversal" of relative velocity in elastic collisions</h3>
					<div>
						<p>If an elastic collision occurs between masses \(m\) and \(M\) with initial velocities \(v_0\) and \(V_0\), respectively, momentum conservation and energy conservation dictate</p>
						$$mv_0 + MV_0 = mv + MV$$
						$$\frac{1}{2}m{v_0}^2 + \frac{1}{2}M{V_0}^2 = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 + \frac{1}{2}MV^2$$
						<p>Factoring and solving both equations for \(\frac{m}{M}\), we find</p>
						$$\frac{m}{M} = \frac{V - V_0}{v_0 - v} = \frac{V^2 - {V_0}^2}{{v_0}^2 - v^2}$$
						<p>Recognizing that \(a^2 - b^2 = (a + b)(a - b)\), we find</p>
						\begin{align}
						\frac{V - V_0}{v_0 - v} &= \frac{(V + V_0)(V - V_0)}{(v_0 + v)(v_0 - v)} \\
						v_0 + v &= V_0 + V \\
						\end{align}
						<div class = "answer">$$v_0 - V_0 = -(v - V)$$</div>
						<p>Hence the difference between the initial velocities, a.k.a. the initial relative velocity, is equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to the final relative velocity.</p>
					</div>
					<h3>\(\sin\theta \approx \theta\) and others</h3>
					<div>
						<p>Here are some tricks that can greatly simplify trigonometric expressions.</p>
						<img class = "diagram_m" src = "Small angle approximations.svg"/>
						<p>By definition, \(\tan\theta = \frac{o}{r}\) and \(\theta = \frac{s}{r}\). From the diagram, it's clear that \(o \approx s\) as \(\theta\) becomes smaller and smaller. Thus,</p>
						$$\tan\theta = \frac{o}{r} \approx \frac{s}{r} = \theta$$
						<div class = "answer">$$\tan\theta \approx \theta$$</div>
						<p>Next, \(\sin\theta = \frac{o}{h}\). Again, from the diagram, \(o \approx s\) and \(h \approx r\) as \(\theta\) becomes smaller and smaller. Thus,</p>
						$$\sin\theta = \frac{o}{h} \approx \frac{s}{r} = \theta$$
						<div class = "answer">$$\sin\theta \approx \theta$$</div>
						<p>Applying the same logic for cosine, you might conclude that \(\cos\theta \approx 1\). Unfortunately, it turns out that an approximation based solely on assuming \(h \approx r\) and dividing the two is not quite as precise as ours for sine and tangent. There are several ways to derive the approximiation for cosine, but a clean way involves manipulating our approximation for sine. Recalling that</p>
						\begin{align}
						\cos\left(2\theta\right) &= \cos^2\theta - \sin^2\theta \\
						\cos\theta &= \cos^2\left(\frac \theta 2\right) - \sin^2\left(\frac \theta 2\right) \\
						&= 1 - 2\sin^2\left(\frac \theta 2\right) \\
						&\approx 1 - 2\left(\frac \theta 2\right)^2\\
						\end{align}
						<div class = "answer">$$\cos\theta \approx 1 - \frac{\theta^2}{2}$$</div>
					</div>
					<h3>\(U_S = \frac{1}{2}kx^2\): spring potential energy for Hooke's springs</h3>
					<div>
						<p>Hooke's law states that the force exerted by a spring is directly proportional to how far the spring is stretched or compressed:</p>
						$$F_S = kx$$
						<p>If \(x = 0\) is our spring's equilibrium position, integrating \(F_S\) over any stretch or compression \(x\) will tell us the potential energy \(U_S\) stored:</p>
						\begin{align}
						U_S &= \int_{0}^{x}kx \\
						&= k\left(\left.\frac{x^2}{2}\right|_0^x\right) \\
						\end{align}
						<div class = "answer">$$U_S = \frac{1}{2}kx_2$$</div>
					</div>
					<h3>\(\omega\) and \(T\) for simple harmonic motion</h3>
					<div>
						<h4>Regular vs. angular frequency</h4>
						<hr>
						<p>Frequency describes how many cycles something completes in a unit of time (\(\frac{1}{\text{s}}\) or \(\text{hz}\) in SI units).</p>
						<p>Angular frequency is an extension of this concept: it is the angle something covers in a unit of time. "Covers" can mean the angle swept by object spinning in a circle (rotating) or the fraction of a cycle a periodic function, like a sine wave, completes in that time.</p>
						<p>More precisely, it can be written as \(\frac{2\pi}{T}\), where \(T\) is the period of the motion. For circles, \(2\pi\) is one complete revolution (kind of like a cycle). For periodic functions, it is the time the function spends doing something before it repeats itself.</p>
						<h4>Angular frequency and simple harmonic motion</h4>
						<hr>
						<p>We know that an object in simple harmonic motion, like one on the end of a spring, oscillates. Its position can be represented by a sinusoidal function, meaning it is periodic and thus has angular frequency.</p>
						<p>To derive the angular frequency of an object in SHS, we first have to recognize that an object attached to a spring experiences a force \(F = -kx\), for the spring force is always in the direction opposite to the object's displacement relative to its equilibrium position.</p>

						<p>We know that smart people have solved the second-order differential equations to find that an object in SHS's position can be modeled by an equation of the form:</p>
						$$x = B\sin(\omega t) + A\cos(\omega t)$$
						<p>The unknowns in this equation depend on the initial conditions of the system. Let's construct our coordinate system such that the equilibrium position is at the origin. Let's also say that at \(t = 0\), we release the spring from a given amplitude \(A\), thus beginning its oscillation.</p>
						<p>\(\sin0 = 0\), which simplifies things nicely. From differentiation:</p>
						\begin{align} 
						x &= A\cos(\omega t) \\
						v &= -A\omega\sin (\omega t) \\
						a &= -A\omega^2 \cos(\omega t) \\
						\end{align}
						<p>Now that we have expressions for \(x\) and \(a\) in terms of \(t\), we can substitute these into our original force equation and discover new relationships.</p>
						$$m(-B\omega^2 \cos(\omega t)) = -k(B\cos(\omega t))$$
						<div class = "answer">$$\omega = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}$$</div>
						<p>So the angular frequency of an object oscillating at the end of a spring is dependent solely on the spring constant \(k\) and its own mass \(m\), <em>not</em> the amplitude.</p>
						<p>And since \(\omega = \frac{2\pi}{T}\), we can solve for \(T\):</p>
						<div class = "answer">$$T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{m}{k}}$$</div>
					</div>
					<h3>\(y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)\): point-slope form</h3>
					<div>
						<p>Point-slope form is convenient when you need to write an equation for a line with slope \(m\) that contains the point \(\left(x_1, \text{ }y_1\right)\). Given another point at \(\left(x, \text{ }y\right)\),</p>
						$$m = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{y - y_1}{x - x_1}$$
						<div class = "answer">$$y - y_1 = m\left(x - x_1\right)$$</div>
					</div>
					<h3>\(\frac{dx^n}{dx} = nx^{n - 1}\): power rule</h3>
					<div>
						<p>First, let's prove the power rule for integer values of \(n\). This is a simple proof that uses the definition of the derivative.</p>
						\begin{align}
						\frac{dx^n}{dx} &= \lim_{h \to 0}\frac{\left(x + h\right)^n - x^n}{h} \\
						&= \lim_{h \to 0}\frac{{n \choose 0}x^n + {n \choose 1}x^{n - 1}h + {n \choose 2}x^{n - 2}h^2 + \cdots + {n \choose n}h^n - x^n}{h} \\
						&= \lim_{h \to 0}{n \choose 1}x^{n - 1} + \lim_{h \to 0}{n \choose 2} x^{n - 2}h + \cdots + \lim_{h \to 0}{n \choose n}h^{n - 1} \\
						\end{align}
						<p>Since all the terms are simple products that have an \(h\), they become zero when \(h \to 0\). Thus, we are left with the first term and the conclusion:</p>
						<div class = "answer">$$\frac{dx^n}{dx} = nx^{n - 1}$$</div>
						<p>We can extend the power rule to include rational exponents (e.g., fractions). To do this, we will use a creative implicit technique. Suppose we have a function whose parameter is some variable \(x\) raised to some rational power. Since the exponent is rational, we know it can be written as the quotient of two integers, \(p\) and \(q\). We want to find the derivative of \(x^{\frac{p}{q}}\) with respect to \(x\), or \(frac{df}{dx}\).</p>
						\begin{align}
						f &= x^{\frac{p}{q}} \\
						f^q &= x^p \\
						\end{align}
						<p>We exponentiate to eliminate the fractional exponents. This allows us to use the power rule we have derived for integer exponents. Remembering the chain rule,</p>
						\begin{align}
						qf^{q - 1}\frac{df}{dx} &= px^{p - 1} \\
						\frac{df}{dx} &= \frac{px^{p - 1}}{qf^{q - 1}} \\
						&= \frac{px^{p - 1}}{q\left(x^{\frac{p}{q}}\right)^{q - 1}} = \frac{px^{p - 1}}{qx^{p - p/q}} = \frac{p}{q}x^{p - 1 - p + p / q}\\
						\end{align}
						<div class = "answer">$$\frac{dx^\frac{p}{q}}{dx} = \frac{p}{q}x^{\frac{p}{q} - 1}$$</div>
						\end{align}
					</div>
					<h3>\(\frac{d\left(f \cdot g\right)}{dx} = f'g + g'f\): product rule</h3>
					<div>
						<p><strong>Fig plus gif!</strong> This mnemonic for the product rule, \(\left(f \cdot g\right)' = f'g + g'f\), is permanently imprinted in my brain from AP Calculus (thanks, Mr. Deppe!). For the new student, however, it may not seem too intuitive. Fortunately, its proof is another one that utilizes the limit definition of the derivative (with one small trick).</p>
						\begin{align}
						\frac{d\left(f \cdot g\right)}{dx} &= \lim_{h \to 0}\frac{f\left(x + h\right) \cdot g\left(x + h\right) - f\left(x\right) \cdot g\left(x\right)}{h} \\
						\end{align}
						<p>This expression alone seems to be a dead end. Indeed, we must manipulate using a slightly tricky technique before we can proceed.</p>
						<p>Ideally, the derivative of a product of two functions would be related to the derivatives of each of the factor functions. Since we know an equation of the form \(\lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f\left(x + h\right) - f\left(x\right)}{h} = \frac{df}{dx}\), and our current expression for \(\frac{d\left(f \cdot g\right)}{dx}\) sort of looks like that, making our expression factorable seems like a good idea.</p>
						<p>If we want to be able to factor the first term into an expression that includes a familiar expression like \(\lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f\left(x + h\right) - f\left(x\right)}{h}\), we would need to subtract \(g\left(x + h\right) \cdot f\left(x\right)\) from the numerator. We'd also have to add the same term, effectively adding 0 to the equation and preserving it.</p>
						\begin{align}
						\frac{d\left(f \cdot g\right)}{dx} &= \lim_{h \to 0}\frac{f\left(x + h\right) \cdot g\left(x + h\right) - f\left(x\right) \cdot g\left(x + h\right) + f\left(x\right) \cdot g\left(x + h\right) - f\left(x\right) \cdot g\left(x\right)}{h} \\
						&= \lim_{h \to 0}\frac{g\left(x + h\right)\left[f\left(x + h\right) - f\left(x\right)\right] + f\left(x\right)\left[g\left(x + h\right) - g\left(x\right)\right]}{h} \\
						&= \lim_{h \to 0}\frac{g\left(x + h\right)\left[f\left(x + h\right) - f\left(x\right)\right]}{h} + \lim_{h \to 0}\frac{f\left(x\right)\left[g\left(x + h\right) - g\left(x\right)\right]}{h} \\
						&= g\left(x\right)\frac{df}{dx} + f\left(x\right) \frac{dg}{dx} \\
						\end{align}
