		<p>You're having a Nerf gun war in physics class. Suddenly, Bobby interrupts with an intriguing inquiry: <em>How fast does a Nerf bullet travel?</em></p>
		<p>Unfortunately, since we're in high-school physics, we don't have any fancy radar guns or echolocation gizmos. Fortunately, we do have basic lab items. But how exactly can we determine the speed of something as fast as a Nerf bullet?</p>
		
		<p><em>A ballistic pendulum!</em></p>
		
		<h3><em>How</em> it works:</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Measure the mass \(m\) of your bullet, the mass \(M\) of the pendulum bob (whatever block or cannister hangs from it), and the length \(L\) of your pendulum.</li>
			<li>Fire your bullet at the bob (and hope it sticks<sup>[1]</sup>)!</li>
			<li>Measure the angle \(\theta\) the pendulum sweeps out with respect to the vertical axis.</li>
			<li>Plug your data into this:

		<h3><em>Why</em> it works:</h3>
		<p>It may look ugly, but the equation above comes from two of the most fundamental concepts in physics: conservation of energy and conservation of momentum.</p>
		<p>First, we know that a collision occurs between our bullet and the pendulum bob. It's tempting to think that energy is conserved, but remember: energy can be lost through heat, sound, and unmeasurable vibrations. </p>
		<p>Momentum to the rescue! Recall that the linear momentum of a system is conserved as long as no external force acts upon our system<sup>[2]</sup>. The beauty of the ballistic pendulum is, since our bullet "sticks" to the pendulum bob, we can say the bullet and bob combine into one big "blob" with mass \((m + M)\) and initial velocity \(v_b\).</p>
		<p>Using linear momentum conservation,</p>
		\begin{align}		
		mv_0 &= \left(m + M\right)v_b \\
		v_0 &= \frac{\left(m + M\right)v_b}{m} \\
		\end{align}
		
		<p>Now, since we know both the blob's mass and velocity, we have an expression for its kinetic energy. After the blob begins swinging, the only force that can affect its velocity is gravity, a conservative force, meaning energy is conserved. In equation form,</p>
		\begin{align}
		\frac{1}{2}\left(m + M\right){v_b}^2 &= \left(m + M\right)gh \\
		v_b &= \sqrt{2gh} \\
		\end{align}
		<p>Here is where \(\theta\) comes in, as we don't actually know \(h\) directly. A diagram helps:</p>
		<img class = "diagram" src = "Ballistic pendulum 2.svg"/>
		\begin{align}
		\cos\theta &= \frac{L - h}{L}\\
		h &= L\left(1 - \cos\theta\right) \\
		\end{align}
		<div class = "answer">$$v_0 = \frac{\left(m + M\right)\sqrt{2gL\left(1 - \cos\theta\right)}}{m}$$</div>
		<hr>
		<h3>Up and over</h3>
		<p>Is it possible to make the pendulum swing completely around if the bullet is fast enough?</p>

			<p>The critical moment is when our blob is at the apex of its circular path. If its initial velocity \(v_b\) is too slow, it will never make it; it could also fly past the apex safely but do so with excess speed.</p>

			<p>The sweet spot turns out to be when the blob is in free fall for <em>one instant</em> at the apex. This makes sense: if the blob is in free fall before the apex, it will arc downwards and fail to reach the apex entirely. If it is moving too fast, gravity alone will not be able to force it into a circular path, and the arm of the pendulum will have to contribute a radial tension-like force.</p>

			<p>First, we can use \(F_\text{rad} = m\frac{v^2}{R}\) to find the speed \(v_a\) of the blob at the apex if gravity is to provide all the centripetal force needed there<sup>[3]</sup>.</p>
			\begin{align}
			F_\text{rad} &= F_g \\
			\left(m + M\right) \frac{{v_a}^2}{L} &= \left(m + M\right)g \\
			v_a &= \sqrt{gL} \\
			\end{align}
			<p>Using energy conservation, we can work backwards to find the initial blob velocity \(v_b\) required if \(v_a = \sqrt{gL}\). Fortunately, we don't have to deal with angles this time, as the final height is just twice the length of the arm.</p>
			\begin{align}
			\frac{1}{2}\left(m + M\right){v_b}^2 &= \frac{1}{2}\left(m + M\right){v_a}^2 + 2\left(m + M\right)gL \\
			v_b &= \sqrt{5gL} \\
			\end{align}
			<p>From momentum conservation, \(v_0 = \frac{\left(m + M\right)v_b}{m} \), so</p>

		<h3>Notes</h3>
		
		<div class = "footnote">
			<p><sup>1</sup> Even if the bullet flies into the container and bounces around, we can still use momentum conservation in our calculations—as long as we use the center of mass of the blob, meaning we might have to adjust our distances.</p>
			<p><sup>2</sup> But gravity is exerting a downwards force on the bullet during the collision. Doesn't this mean momentum isn't conserved? Ah—we assume our collision is instanteous, meaning there is no time over which gravity can affect the motion of the objects in our system.</p>
			<p><sup>3</sup> You may be tempted to use the result we found in the previous section and plug in \(\theta = 180^{\circ}\). This approach returns the speed the bullet must be traveling at in order for the pendulum to swing and stop at the apex—without completing a full circle.</p>
