		<h2>Dropping on a Scale</h2>
	</div>
	<div class = "section_subpage">
		<p>Surely you've jumped onto a scale and seen the poor needle spike to a high reading. And naturally, you've wondered how you might approximate that reading using physics?</p>

		<p>Well, you've certainly come to the right place!</p>

		<p>The scale works by converting the spring force \(kx\) it feels to a reading \(R\), which implies that \(Rg = kx\).</p>
		<p>Let's begin with a base case. Suppose we gently set a mass \(m\) on the scale.</p>
		<img class = "diagram_m" src = "Scale 1.svg"/>
		<p>Our goal is to find the maximum reading \(R_1\). Intuitively, this should occur when the spring is most compressed. Once again, energy conservation makes finding the maximum compression \(x_1\) easy. Given the diagram,</p>
		\begin{align}
		mgx_1 &= \frac{1}{2}k{x_1}^2 \\
		x_1 &= \frac{2mg}{k} \\
		\end{align}
		<p>Here is where things become trickier. In the real world, \(m\) would bounce up and down for a short while before stopping because of friction at the (new) equilibrium position of the spring<sup>[1]</sup>. Assuming the scale is properly calibrated, the reading at equilibrium \(R_0\) should reflect the actual mass of the object, that is \(R_0 = m\).</p>
		<p>The equilibrium point is where the forces on the mass are balanced. Thus,</p>
		\begin{align}
		mg &= kx_0 \\
		x_0 &= \frac{mg}{k} \\
		\end{align}
		<p>If we examine the relationship between \(x_0\) and \(x_1\), we can make inferences about the relationship between \(R_0\) and \(R_1\), thanks to the fact that the compression/stretch of the spring is directly proportional to the spring force, and thus scale reading.</p>
		\begin{align}
		x_1 &= 2\left(\frac{mg}{k}\right) = 2x_0 \\
		R_1 &= 2R_0 \\
		 &= 2m \\
		\end{align}
		<p>Indeed, the maximum stretch is twice the equilibrium stretch; the maximum reading is twice the equilibrium (i.e., "correct") reading.</p>
		<hr>
		<h3>Dropping a mass onto a scale</h3>
		<p>You've made it to part 2. The math is messier, but the procedure is the same.</p> 
		<p>We start again with energy conservation. This time, however, there are two heights to consider: (1) how far the mass is above the scale before the drop and (2) how far the spring compresses after the mass lands on it.</p> 
		<img class = "diagram_m" src = "Scale 2.svg"/>
		\begin{align}
			mg\left(h + x_2\right) &= \frac{1}{2}k{x_2}^2 \\
			0 &= \frac{1}{2}k{x_2}^2 - mgx_2 - mgh \\
			x_2 &= \frac{mg \pm \sqrt{mg\left( mg + 2hk\right)}}{k} \\
			\end{align}
			

		<p>The fact that the spring's compression is directly proportional to its reading implies that the relationship between \(x_1\) and \(x_2\) is equivalent to the relationship between \(R_1\) and \(R_2\). In equation speak,</p>
		\begin{align}
			\frac{x_2}{x_1} &= \frac{R_2}{R_1} \\
			R_2 &= \frac{R_1x_2}{x_1} \\
			&= 2m\left(\frac{mg \pm \sqrt{mg\left( mg + 2hk\right)}}{k} \times \frac{k}{2mg}\right) \\
			\end{align}

		<h4>Follow-up questions</h4>
		<hr>
		<ol>
			<li>What's with the \(\pm\)?</li>
			We're only interested in the plus, really, but the minus case should make sense, too. Since the mass begins oscillating once it becomes one with the spring, there will be two "extreme" cases: when the mass is at the bottommost position in the cycle and when it is at the top. 
			Here is where we make our most critical assumption.
			Here is where we make our most critical assumption. We know a collision occurs between the falling mass and the top of the spring. Normally, we would want to apply conservation of momentum, but we are missing the mass of the top of the scale. We could modify the following derivation to include the unknown mass of the scale board, but the mass is likely so small that it is negligible. Let us then assume that the scale effortlessly "accepts" / "becomes one" with the falling mass without any loss of energy. Then:
			<li>What about jumping on the scale? Would the scale read the same on the way up and down?</li>
			<li>Did you make a mistake? Why are the results of calculations so high?</li>
			<li>What if the mass bounces off</li>
			Indeed, this activity involved a lot of big assumptions. 
		</ol>

		<h3>Notes</h3>
		<div class = "footnote">
			<p><sup>1</sup> In our perfect world, however, there is no friction to slow the bouncing, so our mass will continue oscillating forever. Note that on each pass through \(x_0\), the mass has velocity, meaning it will overshoot the point until the spring force pulls it back. (Fortunately, this doesn't change the fact that the scale should read \(R_0 = m\) when the mass is at \(x_0\).)</p>
