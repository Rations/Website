		<p>Friction is a reactive force that occurs when two objects slide or try to slide <em>relative to each other</em>. 
		<h3>Determining the direction of the friction force</h3>
		<p>This issue can be tricky if we are not precise. Speaking from experience, friction is a resistive forceâ€”it opposes motion in some way. There are two types of friction:</p>
		<p>Kinetic friction acts upon two contacting surfaces already moving against each other. It always opposes the direction in which the surfaces are moving relative to each other. 

		<h3>Causes</h3>
