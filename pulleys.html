		<h3>The Atwood's machine</h3>

		<p>Suppose we have an Atwood's machine: a massless pulley over which two different masses, \(m\) and \(M\), hang via a massless string. How might we find the accelerations of the masses?</p>
		<img class = "diagram_m" src = "Pulleys 4.svg"/>
		<p>First, we will take the meticulous path to the solution. (We will see a quicker way, but the meticulous way is useful because it can be applied to more elaborate problems.)</p>
		<p>Defining upwards to be positive, we can write force equations and eliminate \(T\)<sup>[1]</sup>:</p>
		\begin{align}
		T - mg &= ma_m \\
		T - Mg &= Ma_M \\
		\implies ma_m + mg &= Ma_M + Mg\\
		\end{align}
		<h3>Conservation of string</h3>
		<p>Never overlook constraints introduced by the physical setup of the problem. In this case, the rope is always taut, meaning it does not compress or stretch. This implies that two objects connected by the rope will experience the same magnitude of acceleration relative to the pulley.</p>
		<div id = "menu">
			<h3>We can show this more rigorously using calculus.</h3>
			<div>
				Divide the rope's length \(l\) into three parts as shown in the diagram:</p>
			<img class = "diagram_m" src = "Pulleys 3.svg"/>
			<p>We know the length of the rope must remain constant over time (\(\frac{dl}{dt} = 0\)). Therefore, after differentiating twice,</p>
		\begin{align}
		l  &= x + \pi R + y \\
		0 &= \frac{dx}{dt} + 0 + \frac{dy}{dt} \\
		0 &= \frac{d^2x}{dt^2} + \frac{d^2y}{dt^2} \\
		
		\end{align}
		<p>Again, because the rope is taut, any changes to \(x\) and \(y\) will correspond to changes in the position/velocity of \(m\) and \(M\), respectively. In other words,</p>
		$$a_m = -a_M$$ 
			</div>
		</div>

		<p>So we have used a physical constraint to find a relationship between the accelerations. Now we can solve for \(a_m\) easily.</p>
		\begin{align}
		ma_m + mg &= Ma_M + Mg \\
		&= -Ma_m + Mg \\
		a_m\left(m + M\right) &= g\left(M - m\right) \\
		\end{align}

		<h3>The shortcut</h3>
		<p>Recognizing the shortcut takes place at the conservation of string step. Since we know that the string and masses all move and accelerate at the same rate, we can group them into one system. The mass of the system is \(m + M\), and \(T\) becomes an irrelevant internal force of the system. After defining clockwise about the pulley to be positive, Newton's second law yields</p>
		\begin{align}
		Mg - mg &= \left(M + m\right)a \\
		a &= g\left(\frac{M - m}{M + m}\right) \\
		\end{align}
		<p>No surprise—everything accelerates at the same rate about the pulley.</p>
		<hr>
		<h3>Double Atwood's machine</h3>
		<p>What if we keep a mass \(m_1\) hanging from the left side of the pulley, but replace the right mass with a whole new Atwood's machine on which hang \(m_2\) and \(m_3\)?</p>
		<img class = "diagram" src = "Pulleys 5.svg"/>
		<p>We can't take the shortcut we did in the previous problem because different parts of our double Atwood's machine move at different rates. First, after defining upwards to be positive, we can write several force equations:</p>
		\begin{align}
		T - m_1g &= m_1a_1 \\
		T_2 - m_2g &= m_2a_2 \\
		T_2 - m_3g &= m_3a_3 \\
		T - 2T_2 &= 0\left(a_p\right) = 0 \\
		\end{align}
		<p>Notice that the lower pulley must be taken into consideration, since it is accelerating translationally at some \(a_p\). Because it is massless, the sum of the forces on it must be zero (otherwise it would accelerate at an infinite rate).</p>
		<p>Now for the tricky part. Like last time, we need to find a relationship between the accelerations, in this case \(a_1\), \(a_2\), and \(a_3\). The upper pulley is effectively fixed, so conservation of string dictates that relative to the Earth,</p> 
		$$a_1 = -a_p$$
		<p>It is extremely tempting to do the same for \(m_2\) and \(m_3\) on the lower pulley and say \(a_2 = -a_3\). But this relationship is only true <em>relative to the lower pulley</em>, which is itself accelerating at \(a_p\) because of \(m_1\). Don't worry—we can still make use of this relationship using some intuition and acceleration adding.</p>
		<img class = "diagram_m" src = "Pulleys 1.svg"/>
		<p>We have established that the lower pulley is accelerating at \(a_p = -a_1\). Let's say that, relative to the lower pulley, \(m_2\) and \(m_3\) have accelerations \(a_{2\text{, }p}\) and \(a_{3\text{, }p}\), respectively. Thus, their accelerations relative to the Earth are</p>
		\begin{align}
		a_2 &= a_{2\text{, }p} + a_p \\
		a_3 &= -a_{2\text{, }p} + a_p \\
		\end{align}
		<p>Eliminating \(a_{2\text{, }p}\), we have:</p>
		\begin{align}
		a_2 - a_p &= a_p - a_3 \\
		a_p &= \frac{a_2 + a_3}{2} \\
		a_1 &= -\frac{a_2 + a_3}{2} \\
		\end{align}

		<div id = "menu2">
			<h3>For math-y people, there is a calculus-based approach as well.</h3>
			<div>
				<img class = "diagram" src = "Pulleys 2.svg"/>
		<p>From geometry, we can see that the length \(c\) can be written in terms of the others.</p>
		\begin{align}
		c &= \frac{b + d + l - \pi R}{2} \\
		\end{align}
		<p>Differentiating twice essentially returns a constraint equation comprising the accelerations we are interested in.</p>
		\begin{align}
		\frac{d^2c}{dt^2} &= \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{d^2b}{dt^2} + \frac{d^2d}{dt^2} + 0 - 0\right) \\
		a_\text{pulley} &= -a_1 = \frac{a_2 + a_3}{2} \\
		a_1 &= -\frac{a_2 + a_3}{2} \\
		\end{align}
			</div>
		</div>

		<p>Now that we have all the necessary equations, it is simply a matter of algebra before we find the final answers.</p>
		\begin{align}
		T &= m_1a_1 + m_1g \\
		T_2 &= \frac{T}{2} = \frac{m_1a_1}{2} + \frac{m_1g}{2} \\
		-2a_1 &= a_2 + a_3 \\
		a_2 &= \frac{T_2 - m_2g}{m_2} \\
		&= \frac{m_1a_1}{2m_2} + \frac{m_1g}{2m_2} - g \\
		\end{align}
		<p>In the same way,</p>
		\begin{align}
		a_3 &= \frac{m_1a_1}{2m_3} + \frac{m_1g}{2m_3} - g \\
		\end{align}
		<p>Thus:</p>
		\begin{align}
		-2a_1 &= \frac{m_1a_1}{2m_2} + \frac{m_1g}{2m_2} - g + \frac{m_1a_1}{2m_3} + \frac{m_1g}{2m_3} - g \\
		-2a_1 - \frac{m_1a_1}{2m_2} - \frac{m_1a_1}{2m_3} &= \frac{m_1g}{2m_2} + \frac{m_1g}{2m_3} - 2g \\
		a_1 \left(-2 - \frac{m_1}{2m_2} - \frac{m_1}{2m_3}\right) &= g\left(\frac{m_1}{2m_2} + \frac{m_1}{2m_3} - 2\right) \\
		-a_1\left(\frac{m_1(m_2 + m_3) + 4m_2m_3}{2m_2m_3}\right) &= g\left(\frac{m_1(m_2 + m_3) - 4m_2m_3}{2m_2m_3}\right) \\
		\end{align}
		<div class = "answer">$$a_1 = g\frac{4m_2m_3 - m_1(m_2 + m_3)}{4m_2m_3 + m_1(m_2 + m_3)}$$</div>

		<h3>Notes</h3>
		<div class = "footnote">
			<p><sup>1</sup> The tension \(T\) must be the same at all points along the rope because the rope is massless. Given a small piece of rope, if the tensions on either side of this rope were unequal, then the piece would accelerate at an infinite rate.</p>
