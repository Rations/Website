		<p>Even if you jump as hard as you can, you immediately fall back to the Earth thanks to gravity. But given enough speed, it is clearly possible for a spaceship, missile, or <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Plumbbob#Propulsion_of_steel_plate_cap">perhaps manhole cover</a> to escape the gravitational field of the Earth. How can we find this speed?</p>
		<p>The simplest way is using energy conservation. Suppose we have a particle of mass \(m\) sitting on a planet of mass \(M\). We would like to find the gravitational potential energy of \(m\).</p>
		<p>Potential energy calculations are flexible: you are free to set \(PE = 0\) at any arbitrary point \(O\) that's most useful to you. Then, if you have an object at another point \(P\), the object's \(PE\) at \(P\) is equal to the work you would have to do on the object to move it from the first point (\(O\)) to the second point (\(P\)).</p>
		<p>When we are working with objects that are very small in relation to the Earth in the reference frame of the Earth, we often set \(PE = 0\) at the Earth's surface.</p>
		$$F_g = G\frac{m_1m_2}{r^2}$$
		<p>Recall Newton's law of universal gravitation. When dealing with things of astronomical proportions, it is often convenient to set \(PE = 0\) at a distance \(\infty\) away from the object. This makes sense: when two objects are infinitely apart, there is essentially no gravitational force between them (as \(r \to \infty\), \(F_g \to 0\)), so the object does not feel the urge to "fall back" to anywhere.</p>
		\begin{align}
			U_g &= \int_{r_0}^{r} F_gdr \\
				&= \int_{\infty}^{R} G\frac{Mm}{r^2}dr \\
				&= GMm \left.\left(-\frac{1}{r}\right|_{\infty}^{R}\right) \\
				&= GMm \left(-\frac{1}{R} - 0\right) \\
				&= -\frac{GMm}{R} \\ 
		\end{align}
		<p>Now, at launch, the particle must possess at least as much kinetic energy as potential energy; otherwise, sooner or later, it would "fall back" to the planet. Somehow, it must make its way to a point where its potential energy is zero:</p>
		$$KE_0 + PE_0 = KE$$
		<p>It doesn't matter what velocity we have at the end. We should be alright as long as there is no potential energy. We are trying to find the cutoff, the velocity that will just allow us to escape the gravitational field of the planet, so we can set the final velocity \(v\), and thus \(KE\), to zero.</p>
		\begin{align}
			KE_0 + PE_0 &= 0 \\
			\frac{1}{2}m{v_e}^2 - \frac{GMm}{R} &=  \\
		\end{align}

		<h4>The case of two planets</h4>
		<hr>
		<p>What if we are transported to a binary star system, where two stars orbit about each other? Would the escape velocity of a mass on the surface of one of the stars be different?</p>
		<p>Fortunately, the problem is not too difficult to tackle. It turns out that we can analyze the gravitational potential energy the mass in relation to each of the stars separately. If star 1 is the one on which whose surface the mass rests:</p>
		$$U_{1} = -\frac{GM_1m}{R}$$
		<p>In other words, it is identical to the expression in the previous problem.</p>
		<p>Now we can find the potential energy of the mass in relation to the second star. All we need to know is the distance \(d\) between the mass and the center of star 2:</p>
		$$U_{2} = -\frac{GM_2m}{D}$$
		<p>Now, to find the total potential energy:<p>
			\begin{align}
			KE_0 + U_1 + U_2 &= 0 \\
			\frac{1}{2}m{v_e}^2 - \frac{GM_1m}{R} -\frac{GM_2m}{D} &= \\
			\end{align}
