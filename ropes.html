	<h3>Tension in a hanging rope with mass</h3>
	<p>We are often fortunate enough to deal with only massless ropes. The tension is the same at all points in such ropes; otherwise parts of the rope would accelerate at an infinite rate due to the imbalance of forces. This, however, is not the case in real ropes with mass. Intuitively, the piece of rope at the top must "carry" the entire weight of the rope, whereas the bottom need not carry anything.</p>
	<p>Suppose we have a rope of uniform mass \(M\) and length \(L\). We want to find the tension \(T_x\) in the rope at any distance \(x\) from its hanging point.</p>
	<p>When solving such problems, we can sometimes avoid messy integration by choosing the right FBD system. In this case, let's choose the piece of rope of mass \(m\) and length \(l\) spanning from the bottom point to \(x\)<sup>[1]</sup>.</p>
	<img class = "diagram" src = "Ropes 1.svg"/>
	<p>Since the rope is of uniform mass, we know the mass–length ratio of any rope segment is equal to the mass–length ratio \(\rho = \frac{M}{L}\) of the whole rope. From geometry, we can see that \(l = L - x\). Thus,</p>
	\begin{align}
	m &= \rho l = \frac{M\left(L - x\right)}{L} \\
	\end{align}
	<p>Newton's second law takes care of the rest. Our piece of rope is stationary, so</p>
	\begin{align}
	T_x - mg &= 0 \\
	\end{align}
	<div class = "answer">$$T_x = \frac{Mg\left(L - x\right)}{L}$$</div>

	<h3>Tension in a rope hanging from a tree</h3>
	<p>A drooping chain (or clothesline, power line, etc.) looks like a parabola, but it's actually not. Because they have mass, such objects actually form a shape called a catenary, whose derivation is quite complicated.</p>
	<p>Once again, however, if we choose the right systems, we can find some physical properties of the chain with relative ease. As long as we know the angle \(\theta\) the ends of the chain form with the horizontal, we can find the tension at the ends and middle of the chain.</p>
	<p>To find \(T_\text{end}\), let's consider the entire rope as our system. A FBD shows that acting on it are gravity as well as two \(T_\text{end}\)s:</p>
	<img class = "diagram" src = "Ropes 2.svg"/>
	<p>Our chain is not accelerating in the horizontal direction, so we know from Newton's second law that the two \(T_\text{end}\)s must be equal in magnitude, provided the ends are at the same height. In the vertical direction, we have</p>
	\begin{align}
	2T_\text{end} \sin\theta - Mg &= 0 \\
	\end{align}
	<div class = "answer">$$T_\text{end} = \frac{Mg}{2\sin\theta}$$</div>
	
	<p>To find \(T_\text{mid}\), you might think of limits and infintesimals, but the problem is easy if we choose half the chain as our system, like so:</p>
	<img class = "diagram" src = "Ropes 3.svg"/>
	<p>\(T_\text{end}\) doesn't change because we have not altered our chain; we are merely looking at our chain in a different way. Since \(T_\text{mid}\) acts only in the horizontal, we need only consider Newton's second law in the horizontal direction<sup>[2]</sup>:</p>
	\begin{align}
	T_\text{mid} &= T_\text{end}\cos\theta  \\
	&= \frac{Mg}{2\sin\theta}\cos\theta \\
	\end{align}
	<div class = "answer">$$T_\text{mid} = \frac{Mg}{2\tan\theta}$$</div>

	<h3>Notes</h3>

	<div class = "footnote">
		<p><sup>1</sup> This is the logical choice because only one unknown external force acts on the span. If we had chosen a span somewhere in the middle of the rope, we'd be dealing with two unequal, unknown tensions.</p>
		<p><sup>2</sup> To check whether everything works out in the vertical, consider this: In the original system, we had two \(T_\text{end}\)s pointing upwards as well as mass \(M\). In our new system, we have only one \(T_\text{end}\), but also half the mass. Works out nicely.</p></div>
