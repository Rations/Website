		<h2>Center of Mass</h2></div>
	<div class = "section_subpage">
		<p>We know that applying a torque to any unfixed solid object will cause it to rotate about its center of mass. But exactly how do you find an object's center of mass?</p>
		<p>It turns out that the center of mass is like a weighted average of all the small pieces of mass in an object. First, we have to choose a coordinate system. We can find the coordinate of the center of mass by adding together each mass element multiplied by its distance from the origin. We then divide the sum by the total mass, or the sum of all the mass elements.</p>

		<p>It is really not difficult to come up with a shape whose center of mass is difficult to determine manually. But some shapes are simple enough that we can simply look at them and have a reasonable sense as to where the center of mass should be. Such approaches often make use of symmetries in objects.</p>
		<p>It's worth noting that the center of mass can be at a point where there is nothing. Consider a uniform torus. From symmetry, the center of mass is obviously in the middle of the torus, which is actually empty.</p>
