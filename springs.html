		<p>Have you ever wondered what would happen if you cut a spring in half? Would it become weaker or stronger?</p>
		<h4>Springs in parallel</h4>
		<hr>
		<p>Suppose we have two springs with spring constants \(k_1\) and \(k_2\), respectively. Remember that the force exerted by a Hooke spring can be modeled using \(F_\text{spring} = kx\), where \(x\) is the stretch or compression. We hang both from the ceiling and then use a special hook device to connect both to the same mass \(m\). In other words, the device distributes the weight of the mass in such a way that both springs will stretch the same distance.</p>
		<p>Drawing a free-body diagram of \(m\) and defining the upwards direction to be positive, we can easily see:</p>
		\begin{align}
		mg &= F_\text{spring 1} + F_\text{spring 2} \\
		&= k_1x + k_2x \\
		&= \left(k_1 + k_2\right)x \\
		\end{align}
		<p>This result is very interesting. Notice that when the equation is written in this form, it resembles the generic Hooke spring equation, \(F_\text{spring} = kx\), except we have \(k_1 + k_2\) instead of \(k\). </p>
		<p>In fact, this means that hanging a mass from two (or more) springs with different spring constants is essentially the same as hanging the mass from a single spring with an effective spring constant \(k_\text{eff}\) of \(k_1 + k_2 + \cdots \).</p>
		<div class = "answer">$$k_\text{eff} = k_1 + k_2 + \cdots + k_n$$</div>

		<h4>2. Springs in series</h4>
		<hr>
		<p>What if you had a bunch of springs hanging from each other? What would \(k_\text{eff}\) be?</p>
		<p>Let's start with two springs, again with spring constants \(k_1\) and \(k_2\), respectively. As long as we assume that our springs are massless, we can use the same free-body-diagram-driven analysis technique. Since our system is in equilibrium, we can write three force equations, though only the following two are important to us:</p>
		\begin{align}
		k_1x_1 - k_2x_2 &= 0 \\
		k_2x_2 - mg &= 0 \\
		\end{align}
		<p>Notice that we must assign different \(x\) values to the two springs now: because they are in series, they don't have to stretch by the same amount.</p>
		<p>We seek an expression of the form \(k_\text{eff}x = mg\). In our case, the total stretch will be equal to the stretch of the first spring plus the stretch of the second spring. Therefore, we have:</p>
		$$k_\text{eff}(x_1 + x_2) = mg$$
		<p>Rearranging the first equation, we have \(x_1 = \frac{k_2x_2}{k_1}\). Rearranging the second equation, we have \(x_2 = \frac{mg}{k_2}\). Substituting our new expression for \(x_2\) into that for \(x_1\), we have:</p>
		\begin{align}
		k_\text{eff}(x_1 + x_2) &= k_\text{eff}\frac{k_2mg}{k_1k_2} + \frac{mg}{k_2} = mg \\
		k_\text{eff} &= \frac{k_1 + k_2}{k_1k_2} \\
		\end{align}

		<div class = "answer">$$k_\text{eff} = \frac{k_1 + k_2 + \cdots + k_n}{k_1k_2 \cdots k_n}$$</div>
		<p>Now, you might have noticed that this is equivalent to cutting a spring into multiple parts. If you cut the spring, the total stretch \(x\) should not change.</p>
