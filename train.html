		<h2>Trains and Free-Body Diagrams</h2></div>
	<div class = "section_subpage">
		<p>Suppose we have a locomotive of mass \(M\) attached to \(N\) boxcars of mass \(m\), all accelerating at \(a\). If our world is frictionless, what forces does each car experience?</p>
		<p>This seemingly simple example really illustrates the importance of choosing your system carefully and drawing free-body diagrams.</p>
		<hr>
		<h3>Force generated by the locomotive</h3>
		
		<p>It is often easiest to start with defining your system as one big block. You can do this because the engine and wagons are all connected by rigid steel locks that cannot compress or stretch, meaning that if one car moves, the others have to move along at the exact same rate.</p>
		<p>If we define our system as one big block, we can easily use Newton's second law to find the force generated by the engine, which is the only car in our system that can generate force.</p>

		<div class = "answer">$$F = (M + Nm)a$$</div>
		<hr>
		<h3>Force felt by the last car</h3>
		
		<p>Now, let us consider car \(N\), the last car of the train. In terms of free-body diagrams, imagine drawing a bubble around the last car and examining only the forces that are exerted through the membrane of the bubble:</p>
		<img class = "diagram_s" src = "Train 2.svg"/>
		<p>The important thing to notice here is that car \(N\) is <em>not</em> being pulled forward by \(F\), but rather a different force \(T_N\) from the steel locks between itself and the car before it. Since we know the mass of each boxcar and that only one force acts on car \(N\) in the horizontal direction, applying Newton's second law is again easy:</p>
		<div class = "answer">$$T_N = ma$$</div>
		<p>We can proceed down the line of cars from the rear. Let's draw a bubble around the second-to-last car, car \(N - 1\):</p>
		<img class = "diagram_s" src = "Train 3.svg"/>
		<p>There are two opposite forces on it in the horizontal direction: As a consequence of Newton's third law, pulling car \(N - 1\) backwards is the force \(T_{N - 1}\), which is again applied through the steel lock connecting cars \(N - 1\) and \(N\). Likewise, there is a force \(T_{N - 1}\) in the forward direction from the car in front of it. If forward is positive:</p>
		\begin{align}
		\sum F &= ma \\
		T_{N - 1} - T_N &= ma \\
		\end{align}
		<div class = "answer">$$T_{N - 1} = 2ma$$</div>
		<hr>
		<h3>Force felt by the \(N\)th car</h3>
		
		<p>We could continue this recursive process by looking at car \(N - 2\) and the forces \(T_{N - 2}\) and \(T_{N - 1}\), but there is an easier way. Here is where choosing a system carefully helps with the analysis.</p>
		<p>Suppose wanted to the find the force from in front of car \(x\). To do this, we can draw a bubble around the last \(N - x + 1\) cars:</p>
		<img class = "diagram_s" src = "Train 4.svg"/>
		<p>Again, we know everything within this bubble will be moving at the same acceleration thanks to the rigid connectors between cars, and that the force causing the cars to accelerate must be from an external source (i.e., through the steel locks).</p>
		\begin{align}
		\sum F &= ma \\
		\end{align}
		<div class = "answer">$$T_x = (N - x + 1)ma$$</div>
		
		<p>Therefore, car \(x\) is being pulled forward by \(T_x = (N - x + 1)ma\) and backwards by \(T_{x + 1} = (N - x)ma\).</p>
