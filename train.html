		<h2>The "Free-Body" Train</h2>
	</div>
	<div class = "section_subpage">
		<p>Say we have a locomotive of mass \(M\) attached to \(N\) boxcars of mass \(m\) accelerating at \(a\). In a perfect (read: frictionless) world, what forces would each car experience?</p>
		<p>This seemingly simple example actually illustrates the importance of choosing the most convenient system to analyze.</p>
		<hr>
		<h3>Force generated by the locomotive</h3>
		
		<p>We can sometimes define our system as one big unit, ignoring the small parts within it. In this case, the entire train is like one big "block" being accelerated by a single external force, \(F\). Defining the system this way is okay because the locomotive and boxcars are all connected by rigid locks that cannot compress or stretch, meaning that if one part of the train moves, the rest of the train must move along at the exact same rate. (Also remember that the locomotive is the only car that can generate any force.)</p>
		<p>Newton's second law allows us to find \(F\).</p>
		<img class = "diagram_s" src = "Train 1.svg"/>
		<div class = "answer">$$F = (M + Nm)a$$</div>
		<hr>
		<h3>Force felt by the last car</h3>
		
		<p>What about car \(N\), the last car?</p>
		<p>In the spirit of FBDs, imagine drawing a bubble around the last car and examining only the forces that are exerted through it:</p>
		<img class = "diagram_s" src = "Train 2.svg"/>
		<p>The important thing to notice is that car \(N\) is being pulled forward <em>not</em> by \(F\), but rather by some force \(T_N\) exerted through the lock between car \(N\) and car \(N - 1\). Since only one force acts on car \(N\) in the horizontal direction, applying Newton's second law is again easy:</p>
		<div class = "answer">$$T_N = ma$$</div>
		<p>We can proceed down the line of cars from the rear. Suppose we draw a bubble around the second-to-last car, car \(N - 1\):</p>
		<img class = "diagram_s" src = "Train 3.svg"/>
		<p>As a consequence of Newton's third law, pulling the car backwards is \(T_N\) from car \(N\). There is also the force \(T_{N - 1}\) in the forward direction from car \(N - 2\). If the forward direction is positive,</p>
		\begin{align}
		T_{N - 1} - T_N &= ma \\
		T_{N - 1} - ma &= ma \\
		\end{align}
		<div class = "answer">$$T_{N - 1} = 2ma$$</div>
		<hr>
		<h3>Force felt by the \(N\)th car</h3>
		
		<p>We could continue this rather repetitive recursive routine by looking at car \(N - 2\) and the forces \(T_{N - 2}\) and \(T_{N - 1}\), but there is an easier way. Here is where choosing our system helps.</p>
		<p>Suppose we wanted to find the force \(T_x\) pulling car \(x\) forward. To do so, we could draw a bubble around the last \(N - x + 1\) cars:</p>
		<img class = "diagram_s" src = "Train 4.svg"/>
		<p>Again, we know that everything within this bubble must move at the same rate, so it is fine to treat the collection of cars as one medium-sized block. Convenient, \(T_x\) is the only horizontal external force that acts on the block.</p>
		<div class = "answer">$$T_x = (N - x + 1)ma$$</div>
		
		<p>Therefore, car \(x\) is pulled forward by \(T_x = (N - x + 1)ma\) and backwards by \(T_{x + 1} = (N - x)ma\).</p>
