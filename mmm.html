			<h3>Physics resources</h3>
			<strong>Online:</strong>
			<p><a href = "http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/hframe.html">HyperPhysics</a>, the high-school physics quick-reference Bible.</p>
			<p><a href = "http://physics.stackexchange.com/">Physics Stack Exchange</a> is a clean, efficient forum whose users are dedicated (just look at the vectorized diagrams some users spend time creating!) and knowledgeable (most high-school physics students will not be able to understand half the questions asked).</p>
			<p><a href = "https://www.physicsforums.com/">Physics Forums</a> is similar, but my impression is that it is more receptive to homework-help threads than Stack Exchange is.</p>

			<strong>Print:</strong>
			<p>I've only seen a few, but here are some impressions:</p>
			<a href = "http://www.pearsonhighered.com/educator/product/University-Physics-with-Modern-Physics-Plus-MasteringPhysics-with-eText-Access-Card-Package-14E/9780321982582.page"><img class = "padded_image" src = "Young.jpg" height = "150px"/></a>
			<p>Young and Freedman's <strong><em>University Physics</em></strong> is comprehensive but also inundated with distracting, "user-friendly" graphics and rather dry explanations in small print. The numerous exercises help one become comfortable with applying the basic formulas, but are mostly straightforward and uncreative. It's a good complement to the classroom but probably impossible to self-study with.</p>
			<a href = "http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/physics/general-and-classical-physics/introduction-mechanics-2nd-edition"><img class = "padded_image" src = "K&K.jpg" height = "150px"/></a>
			<p>Affectionately known as <strong>K&K</strong>, Kleppner and Kolenkow's <em>An Introduction to Mechanics</em> is a lovely text for advanced high-schoolers. The explanations are clear and concise, the layout is minimalist, and, best of all, the problems are challenging but well designed.</p>
			<a href = "http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/physics/general-and-classical-physics/introduction-classical-mechanics-problems-and-solutions?format=HB"><img class = "padded_image" src = "Morin.jpg" height = "150px"/></a>
			<p>Morin's <strong><em>Introduction to Classical Mechanics</em></strong> is written in a more casual style than K&K, but it's problems are even more difficult. Most are probably impossible for the average AP Physics C student; I've heard several complain that some problems require a particular "trick" that isn't very useful to know. Nonetheless, they're a good mental workout. In fact, I wish to acknowledge this and K&K as the inspirations for many of the curious physical scenarios discussed on this site.</p>
			<p>The <strong><a href = "http://www.feynmanlectures.info/"><em>Feynman Lectures</em></a></strong> are a great read (Feynman videos are wonderful as well). You can feel Feynman's enthusiasm through the pages, though it must be noted that the Lectures are better for learning concepts intuitively than for specific problem-solving practice. There is, however, a set of fun exercises on the Feynman website.</p>
			<hr id = "howTo">
			<h3>Using this site</h3>
			<p>My goal is to keep this site as minimalist as possible without sacrificing useful colors and graphics. On each subpage, the menu bar is fixed to the top of the screen. In it, you will find:</p>
			<table>
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<a href = "index.html"><img class = "icon" src = "Black queen.svg"/></a><td style = "height: 50px; width: 720px; vertical-align: middle">
						<p><em>Click to return to the RR home page.</em></p></td>
					</tr>
					<a href = "physicsFun.html"><img class = "icon" src = "Rocket.svg"/></a><tr>	
					<td style = "height: 34px; width: 720px; vertical-align: middle">
						<p><em>Click to return to the Physics Fun home page.</em></p></td>
					</tr>
					<img class = "icon" src = "Calc.svg"/><tr>	
					<td style = "height: 50px; width: 720px; vertical-align: middle">
						<p><em>These discussions utilize elementary calculus.</em></p></td>
					</tr>
				</tbody>
			</table>
			
			<p>Equations can be intimidating, so I have tried to use color to alleviate some of the distress they might cause. The end "solutions" to equation derivations are set in light-green, like this:</p>
			<div class = "answer">$$F = m\frac{dv}{dt}$$</div>
			<p>I've also written many input/output calculators so that you can experiment with the nasty equations without having to type them into a handheld calculator. As you can see, they are quite <em>Matrix</em>-y:</p>

			<div class = "calculator">
				<form method = "" action = "">
					Your name =
					<input type = "text" name = "name" value = "" size = "68" onChange = hello()>
					<br>
					Your message =  
					<input type = "text" name = "greeting" value = "" size = "65" onChange = hello()> 
					<br>
				</form>
			</div>
			<hr>
			<h3>Page philosophy</h3>
			<p>Physics Fun is targeted primarily towards curious high-school physics students. Its purpose is not to showcase amazing new insights into physics pedagogy or tricky puzzle problems that require great wit and creativity to solve.</p>
			<p>Some of you smart students might notice that a good deal of the writing in Physics Fun is quite methodically paced, with ample steps shown and explanations given. This is because I think it is very important for students—all learners, really—to grasp even elementary concepts intuitively, and from my experience, many high-school physics classes are paced that prevents the full formation of such intuitive understandings.</p>
			<p>In fact, a big source of personal satisfaction from writing and revising and re-revising this site has come from me re-learning things I had previously been subconsciously confused about. Hopefully browsing these pages will benefit you in a similar way.</p>
