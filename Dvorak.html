<h1>Dvorak Cello Concerto: A Guide to Recordings</h1>
<p>It's the greatest work in the cello repertoire.</p>

<p>Immeasurably difficult to record, it demands from the cellist and orchestra the most in terms of both technique and musicality. Even performances by the greats have more often than not yielded merely mediocre recordings.</p>

<p>Below is a ranking of several of the more popular Dvorak Cello Concerto recordings available. While I recommend listening to each in full, if time is of the essence, the cadenza in the second movement can serve as an introduction to each recording's sound quality and performance style.</p>

<p>Disclaimers:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The ranking is based primarily on the first and second movements, which are superior to the third in my opinion.</li>
	<li>I have not studied the score in detail; thus, when formulating these rankings, I based my conclusions entirely upon what I thought sounded good, not how accurately each cellist captured Dvorak's "ideal performance".</li>
</ul>

<strong>J. du Pré + Barenboim: Chicago Symphony Orchestra (1971)</strong>
<br>
<em>Heart and soul, it's all there.</em>
<p>I may be a little biased, as du Pré's recording was the first I heard. And, as I have come to learn, it is classic du Pré. The playing is ferocious; one can literally hear the bow dig into the strings, for better or worse. What I like most about this recording is the wide spectrum of moods du Pré achieves within a single movement: the loud parts are intense, even aggressive by conservative standards, while the soft parts are soulful and even mournful. I particularly like the way du Pré handles the rapid sixteenth-note passages in the first movement, especially the passage before the recapitulation to the A-theme.</p>

<p>The accompaniment is decent; the largest drawback of this recording is the recording quality. The cello is miked extremely closely, and this, combined with du Pré's occasionally violent style, results in some very ugly noises; the cello sounds like a singer with a sore throat who is straining herself nonetheless. In general, the sonics are boomy and rather dull; there is lots of bass, but not the tight kind we like to hear, but the languid, soggy kind that makes listening for extended periods uncomfortable. Perhaps the orchestra in reality is together, but the mushy reverb makes it sound large and clumsy. The balance between the orchestra and soloist is off, but these factors ultimately do not detract too much from the enjoyability of the performance.</p>

<p>tl;dr: A fine recording of tremendous energy and emotion. If you like such performances, start here. If not, consider starting with Rostropovich.</p>

<strong>M. Rostropovich + Karajan: Berliner Philharmoniker (1969)</strong>
<br>
<em>The least offensive rendition.</em>
<p>Many will claim that Rostropovich is the greatest cellist ever, and that his "legendary" 1969 recording is insurpassable. While Rostropovich can be brilliant, even his interpretations of the Dvorak are not immune to criticism. In many regards, this is a classic rendition: the pacing is perfect, the orchestra is lively, and the recording quality bears the classic 1960s/70s Deutsche Grammophon characteristic shrillness/openness/rawness (many modern recordings are so refined and mellow and warm and fuzzy!). While the Berliners can sometimes be loose in syncronization, there is some wonderful dialogue between instruments here, and the horn section must especially be commended.</p>

<p>Rostropovich plays with wonderful control and momentum. His sound is bold and confident. So what's there not to like? Well . . . not much. It's just that this recording seems too "normal" or "unspecial". Rostropovich's tone is a bit too uniform in that he almost always plays "outwards"—even during the piece's more introverted sections (the B-theme in the first movement, many parts in the second movement, too). It seems that even when there are more soulful portions in the piece, Rostropovich plays them melodramatically rather than introspectively, as though his performance is entirely for his audience, not for his own emotional output. It's almost a Tchaikovsky way of playing—certainly beautiful and passionate—but not entirely so.</p>

<p>tl;dr: Rostropovich's 1969 recording is the least offensive recording available. Good sound and confident playing without the impersonability of Feuermann, the hyper-articulations of Starker, the terrifying ferocity of du Pré. To me, it lacks emotional depth/variance, but you may feel differently.</p>

<strong>P. Fournier + Szell: Berliner Philharmoniker (1962)</strong>
<br>
<em>The Fournier Tone: His Greatest Strength and Weakness</em>
<p>Nestled within the various online forums is a sizeable group of music lovers who swear by Fournier's 1962 rendition. (Interestingly, these people often dismiss Rostropovich's fine DG rendition, almost as if they are bitter because the latter is more well known.) Let me say this: the Fournier is, if anything, overrated. Fournier has wonderful tone, no doubt; adjectives such as full, noble, tight, refined, meaty, smooth, and burnished all come immediately to mind. But Fournier's strength is also his greatest weakness. While his tone is truly euphonious and masterful sounding, I find that Fournier places too much emphasis on individual notes, too much pulsation. An alternate description: there is a lot of "vertical emphasis" in his sound (i.e., pulsations based around individual notes), whereas horizontal momentum (the drive behind broad phrases) is more lacking. This characteristic is especially noticeable after one listens to, say, the Rostropovich recording (also with the Berliner Philharmoniker). In general, the sound quality is decent; the cello is miked slightly closer than desirable, which leads to some passages sounding labored. The orchestra is together, albeit too rigid at some points, for the most part; the only major regret is the awful horn solo in the first movement.</p>

<p>tl;dr: Listen if you want an elegant, refined interpretation.</p>

<img src = "https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/31253437/Dvorak%20Casals.jpg"; align = "left"; alt = "Casals"; height = "200px"; width = "200px"/>
<strong>P. Casals + Szell: Czech Philharmonic Orchestra (1937)</strong>
<br>
<em>A more advanced prototype of Feuermann.</em>
<p>In the first movement at least, Casals plays with much of the "blazing-speed-trumps-all" mentality and technical finesse of Feuermann. Fortunately, however, his accompaniment is responsive. Overall, his rendition of the first movement is quite a bit more emotional than Feuermann's, with instances of rubato. Still, when compared to more modern renditions, the dynamic and emotional range is still quite minimal. Though Casals's second movement is fairly lyrical and successfully establishes a mood change from the first movement (which Feuermann completely failed to do), this basic improvement, coupled with the rather inferior sound quality of the record, does not make the record more attractive overall than its modern competitors.</p>

<p>tl;dr: Essentially a better version of Feuermann's.</p>

<img src = "https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/31253437/Dvorak%20Feuermann.jpg"; align = "left"; alt = "Feuermann"; height = "200px"; width = "200px"/>
<strong>E. Feuermann + Taube: Berlin State Opera Orchestra (1929)</strong> 
<br>
<em>Listen to make yourself feel better about "modern" recordings you thought were bad.</em>
<p>Feuermann is often said to be among the greatest cellists in history. It's a shame you wouldn't be able to tell at all from this particular recording. Its biggest flaw is perhaps the orchestra, which plays with no discernible emotion—or even technical finesse for that matter. Tempos are careless and rhythms are sloppy; the accompaniment is almost militaristic in its rigidity but not at all elegant or majestic. All in all, the orchestra sounds like the pit to some comedic silent film. Feuermann shows off his technique, but the overall result is mechanical, sterile, impatient. There's little emotion here, and sadly, the second movement sounds like a direct continuation of the first in terms of moods evoked.</p>

<p>tl;dr: Uniformly soulless throughout. Listen if you want to hear the fastest tempo attempted (with mediocre results, too).</p>
