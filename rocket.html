    <p>A rocket is a prime example of a device that exploits Newton's third law: propellant ejected downwards from the fuel tank exerts an upwards force on the rocket. If said force exceeds the downwards gravitational force, the rocket accelerates upwards.</p>
    <p>Finding the velocity of firing rocket can be difficult. Newton's second law alone does not satisfy, for the mass of the rocket changes over time as propellant is ejected.</p>
    <p>Fortunately, we still have the impulse-momentum theorem:</p>
    $$F_\text{net}\Delta t = \Delta p = mv - m_0v_0$$
        <img class = "diagram" src = "Rocket 1.svg"/>
    <p>We will take a very methodical approach in our analysis. First, we must determine what given information we need. We need</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The mass \(M\) of the empty rocket</li>
        <li>The rate \(b\) at which the rocket loses mass (i.e., mass of fuel ejected per second)</li>
        <li>The exhaust velocity \(v_e\) at which the fuel is ejected <em>relative to the rocket</em></li> 
    </ul>
    <p>Let's "zoom in" on a moment in time when the rocket is firing and at some velocity \(v\). We will be focusing on a very small quantity of fuel with mass \(\Delta m\) that is about to be ejected. Everything in the rocket, including \(\Delta m\), is traveling at \(v\). Here, momentum in the vertical direction is</p>
    $$p\left(t\right) = \left(m + \Delta m\right)v$$
    <p>The next few moments are critical. As the mass is expelled downwards from the nozzle over a time \(\Delta t\), it exerts an upwards reactive force on the rocket, thus accelerating the rocket upwards. This process continues all the way until \(\Delta m\) loses contact with the rocket.</p>
    <img class = "diagram" src = "Rocket 2.svg"/>
    <p>At the point at which contact is lost, the rocket is at its new speed, \(v + \Delta v\), and \(\Delta m\) is moving away from the rocket at a speed \(v_e\) <em>relative to the new speed of the rocket</em>. The new momentum and change in momentum are thus</p>
    \begin{align}
    p\left(t + \Delta t\right) &= m\left(v + \Delta v\right) + \Delta m \left(v + \Delta v - v_e\right) \\
    \Delta p &= m\Delta v + \Delta m \Delta v - \Delta m v_e \\
    \end{align}
    <p>To make use of the impulse-momentum theorem, we need to choose our system carefully. We are keeping track of both the rocket and the quantity of fuel throughout \(\Delta t\). This allows us to treat the force exerted by the fuel on the rocket as a irrelevant internal force. We must, however, take into account gravity. If upwards is positive,</p>
    \begin{align}
F_g\Delta t &= m\Delta v + \Delta m \Delta v - \Delta m v_e \\
-\left(m + \Delta m\right)g &= \lim_{\Delta t \to 0}m\frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} + \frac{\Delta m \Delta v}{\Delta t} - \frac{\Delta m}{\Delta t} v_e \\
&= m\frac{dv}{dt} - bv_e \\
\frac{bv_e}{m + M} - g &= \frac{dv}{dt}\\
\int_{0}^{t}\frac{bv_edt}{m + M} - \int_{0}^{t}gdt &= \int_{0}^{v}dv\\
m_0 - bt &= m \\
\int_{0}^{t}\frac{bv_edt}{m_0 - bt + M} - \int_{0}^{t}gdt &= \int_{0}^{v}dv\\
u &= m_0 + M - bt \\
dt &= -\frac{dt}{b}\\
-v_e\int_{u_0}^{u}\frac{du}{u} - \int_{0}^{t}gdt &= \int_{0}^{v}dv\\
-v_e\ln\left|\frac{u}{u_0}\right| - gt &= v\\

\end{align}
<div class = "answer">$$v = -v_e\ln\left(\frac{M + m_0 - bt}{M + m_0}\right) - gt$$</div>

Note: The first stage of the Saturn V, the largest rocket ever built, had a mass of approximately 2,250,000 kg when fueled and detached at 65,000 m above the ground. The difference in gravitational force:</a>
G = 6.67 x 10−11
r_e = 6.38 x 10^6 m
m_e = 5.97 × 10^24 kg
m 2.95 x 10^6 kg
F-0 = 2.89 x 10^7
F = 
\begin{align}
F_0 = G\frac{m_em}
\end{align} 



<p>In the case of the water rocket, air in the bottle is pressurized using an external pump. During launch, the pressurized air expands, ejecting the water from the bottle.</p>
 
<p>An important design factor is the composition of the propellant. A mixture primarily composed of air is easily pressurized but lacks mass, meaning it is less capable of exerting a large force on the rocket; even if a large volume of air rapidly exits the nozzle, its effect on the acceleration of the rocket will be minimal. Conversely, water is difficult to compress and expand but possesses fluidity and mass. A finely tuned combination of air and water is thus the most effective propellant.</p>

<h4>Predicting the altitude of the rocket</h4>
<hr>
<p>Calculating the maximum altitude acquired by a rocket is simple if you neglect air resistance, more interesting otherwise. All one needs to make a rough approximation is the time between when the rocket has expelled all its propellant and when it reaches its peak height. Here, we will explore three different techniques.</p> 
<p>The first is the simplest: neglect air resistance, use kinematics and energy conservation. Defining upwards to be the positive direction:<p>
    \begin{align}
    v &= v_0 + at \\
    v_0 &= v - at \\
    &= gt \\
    \end{align}

    <p>By energy conservation, again because we are neglecting air resistance:</p>
    \begin{align}
    \frac{1}{2}m{v_0}^2 &= mgh \\
    h &= \frac{{v_0}^2}{2g} \\
    &= \frac{\left(gt\right)^2}{2g} \\
    \end{align}

    <p>The primary assumption---that drag can be neglected without significantly affecting the validity of the calculations---is, however, deserving of greater scrutiny.</p>
    
    <p>The simplest drag model is a linear relation between the projectile's velocity and the drag force it experiences (i.e., \(F_d = -cv\), where \(c\) is a dimensionless constant that depends on the material properties of the projectile and the surrounding fluid). Perhaps not surprisingly, applying this model to a non-particle-sized water rocket produces extremely questionable results. Assuming a drag coefficient of \(c = 0.75\), as recommended by NASA, and that the upwards direction is positive:</p>
    
    \begin{align}
    \Sigma F &= F_g + F_d = ma \\
    -mg - cv &= m \frac{dv}{dt} \\
    \int_{0}^{t_f} dt &= \int_{v_i}^{0}\frac{mdv}{-mg - cv} \\
    &= -\frac{m}{c} \int_{u_i}^{u_f}\frac{du}{u}    \text{, where } u = mg + cv \\
    t_f &= -\frac{m}{c} \ln \left| \frac{mg}{mg + cv_i} \right| \\
    v_i &= \frac{mg \left(e^{\frac{ct_f}{m}} - 1 \right)}{c} \\
    &= \frac{(\SI{0.35}{kg})g   \left(e^{\frac{0.75(\SI{1.4}{s})}{\SI{0.35}{kg}}} - 1 \right)}{0.75} \\
    &= \SI{87}{m/s}
    \end{align}
    
    A calculation with the full drag equation---$F_d = \frac{1}{2}\rho Acv^2$, where $\rho$ is the air density and $A$ is the cross-sectional area of the projectile---yields very reasonable results.
    
    First, we must use the ideal gas law to calculate air density from air pressure $(p)$ and temperature $(T)$. Using Weather Underground data from 11 June and a known specific gas constant ($R_{\text{specific}}$) of $\SI{287.058}{J/(\kilogram\kelvin)}$:
    \begin{align*}
    \rho &= \frac{p}{R_{\text{specific}}T} \\
    &= \frac{\SI{1.014e5}{Pa}}{(\SI{287.058}{J/(\kilogram\kelvin)})(\SI{298}{K})} \\
    &= \SI{1.18}{kg/m^3}
    \end{align*}
    We can then proceed to the main calculations:
    \begin{align*}
    \Sigma F &= F_g + F_d = ma \\
    -mg - \frac{1}{2}\rho Acv^2 &= m \frac{dv}{dt} \\
    \int_{0}^{t_f} dt &= \int_{v_i}^{0}\frac{mdv}{-mg - \frac{1}{2}\rho Acv^2} \\
    &= \int_{v_i}^{0}\frac{mdv}{-mg \left(1 + \frac{\rho Acv^2}{2mg} \right)} \\
    &= -\frac{1}{g}\sqrt{\frac{2mg}{\rho Ac}}   \int_{u_i}^{u_f}\frac{du}{1 + u^2}  \text{, where } u = v\sqrt{\frac{\rho Ac}{2mg}} \\
    t_f &= -\frac{1}{g} \sqrt{\frac{2mg}{\rho Ac}} \left(-\arctan \left(v_i \sqrt{\frac{\rho Ac}{2mg}} \right) \right) \\
    v_i &= \sqrt{ \frac{2mg}{\rho Ac}} \tan \left(gt_f \sqrt{ \frac{\rho Ac}{2mg}} \right) \\
    &= \sqrt{ \frac{2(\SI{0.35}{kg})g}{ \left(\SI{1.18}{kg/m^3}\right) \left(\SI[parse-numbers = false]{\pi 0.0575^2}{m^2}\right) 0.75}} \tan \left(g(\SI{1.4}{s}) \sqrt{\frac{ \left(\SI{1.18}{kg/m^3}\right) \left(\SI[parse-numbers = false]{\pi 0.0575^2}{m^2}\right) 0.75}{2(\SI{0.35}{kg})g}} \right) \\
    &= \SI{15}{m/s}
    \end{align*}
    Thus, ${KE}_i = \SI{38}{J}$, and because $v = \frac{dx}{dt}$:
    \begin{align*}
    \int_{0}^{x_f}dx &= \int_{0}^{t_f}v_idt \\
    &= \int_{0}^{t_f}\sqrt{ \frac{2mg}{\rho Ac}} \tan \left(gt \sqrt{ \frac{\rho Ac}{2mg}} \right)dt \\
    &= \frac{2m}{\rho Ac}   \int_{u_i}^{u_f}\tan u du \text{, where } u = gt\sqrt{\frac{\rho Ac}{2mg}} \\
    x_f &= -\frac{2m}{\rho Ac} \ln \left|\cos \left(gt\sqrt{\frac{\rho Ac}{2mg}} \right) \right| \\
    &= -\frac{2(\SI{0.35}{kg})}{(\SI{1.18}{kg/m^3})(\SI[parse-numbers = false]{\pi 0.0575^2}{m^2})0.75} \ln \left|\cos \left(g(\SI{1.4}{s})\sqrt{\frac{(\SI{1.18}{kg/m^3})(\SI[parse-numbers = false]{\pi 0.0575^2}{m^2})0.75}{2(\SI{0.35}{kg})g}} \right) \right| \\
    &= \SI{10.}{m}
