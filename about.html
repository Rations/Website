	<p><strong>The website</strong> was coded from scratch in HTML starting in June 2015. Graphics and LaTeX are possible thanks to InkScape and MathJax, respectively. Additional thanks go to Codecademy, the University of Chicago, and M. Kelly of Cornell University.</p>

	<p><strong>The webmaster</strong> currently resides in Ithaca, NY, but has lived in everywhere from Albany, NY, to Taipei, Taiwan. In his free time, he enjoys listening to classical music and classic rock. The piano is his primary instrument, though his joy in life is pretending to sing like Freddie Mercury when no one's looking.</p>
