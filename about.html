	<p><strong>The website</strong> was <a href = "how.html">coded from scratch in HTML</a> starting in June 2015. "Wondergrad" can be interpreted in several ways, but my main hope is that it benefits anyone who likes to wonder about the world or finds some degree of wonder in learning new things. Special thanks go to Codecademy, the University of Chicago, and M. Kelly of Cornell University.</p>

	<p><strong>The webmaster</strong> currently resides in Chicago, IL, but has lived in everywhere from Ithaca, NY, to Taipei, Taiwan. In his free time, he enjoys listening to classical music and classic rock. The piano is his primary instrument, though his joy in life is pretending to sing like Freddie Mercury when no one's looking.</p>
