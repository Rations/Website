		<h3>The bowling ball</h3>
		
		<p>You're bowling when physics strikes again! This time, the challenge is to analyze the motion of a bowling ball as it travels down the alley.</p>
		<p>This is a nice little scenario because it really shows some of the parallels between linear and rotational motionâ€”and how you can analyze them separately. If you think you understand the basic differences between linear and rotational motion well enough, feel free to skip this section.</p>

		<h3>Linear vs. rotational</h3>
		<p>If you haven't ever done so, it's worth your time to consider the basic parallels between linear and rotational motion. This chart might help!</p>

		<h3>Rolling without slipping</h3>
		
		<p>What are the characteristics of a disk that's rolling without slipping?</p>
		<ol>
			<li>It is moving translationally as a whole, so its CM has a velocity \(v\).</li>
			<li>Every point along its edge moves at the same velocity \(v_\text{tan}\) <em>with respect to the CM</em><sup>1</sup>.</li>
			<li>There is no slipping, or relative motion, between the bottom point and the ground. Thus, the bottom point has \(v = 0\) relative to the ground, but \(v_\text{tan}\) relative to the CM. To satisfy these conditions, \(v_\text{CM} = v_\text{tan}\) relative to the ground<sup>2</sup>.</li>
		</ol>
		<img class = "diagram_m" src = "Rolling and slipping 2.svg"/>
		
		<p>Relative to the ground, the bottom point looks naturally looks like the instantaneous pivot point of the disk, as it is stationary. Because the disk is rigid, points far away from the pivot (i.e., points at the top of the disk) will have a higher \(v\) relative to the ground than points closer to the ground. Specifically, in a small moment of time, the top of the disk, which is twice as far from the pivot, moves twice as far as the center of mass does; hence, \(v_\text{top} = 2v_\text{CM}\).</p>
<hr>
		<h3>Bowling ball motion</h3>
		
		<p>We can analyze rotational motion separately from linear motion. When the bowling ball first contacts the alley, it is sliding, but quickly begins spinning as well. All this time, there is also a normal force \(N\) balancing the weight \(Mg\) of the ball.</p>
		<p>Thus, the conditions for kinetic friction are satisfied. Thus, there will be a friction force / torque applied at the edge of the disk, a distance \(R\) from the CM.</p>
		\begin{align}
		F &= \mu Mg \\
		\tau &= \mu MgR \\
		\end{align}
		
		<p>The ball will be rolling without slipping when \(v_{\text{CM}} = v_\text{tan}\), both relative to the ground. Remember, if we know the angular velocity \(\omega\) of the ball, we can find \(v_\text{tan}\) thanks to the radian relationship \(\theta = \frac{s}{r}\), which implies \(\omega = \frac{v_\text{tan}}{r}\):</p>
		<img class = "diagram" src = "Rolling and slipping 1.svg"/>
		<p>We can easily find the linear and angular accelerations. If the direction the ball is moving in is positive and the clockwise direction is positive:</p>
		\begin{align}
		a_{\text{CM}} &= -\mu g \\
		\sum \tau &= I\alpha \\
		\mu Mgr &= \left(\frac{2}{5}MR^2\right)\alpha \\
		\alpha &= \frac{5\mu g}{R} \\
		\end{align}
		<p>Now we can use our kinematic equations for velocity under constant acceleration:</p>
		\begin{align}
		v_\text{CM} &= v_0 - \mu Mgt \\
		\omega &= \frac{5\mu g}{R}t
		\end{align}
		<p>Using the relationship \(\omega = \frac{v_\text{tan}}{R}\), we have:</p>
		\begin{align}
		v_\text{tan} &= 5\mu gt \\
		\end{align}
		<p>We can solve for the time it takes before \(v_{\text{CM}} = v_\text{tan}\) and then find the two velocities themselves:</p>
		\begin{align}
		v_0 - \mu Mgt &= 5\mu gt \\
		t &= \frac{2v_0}{7\mu g} \\
		v_{\text{CM}} &= v_\text{tan} = v_0 - \mu g\left(\frac{2v_0}{7\mu g}\right) \\
		\end{align}
		<div class = "answer">$$v = \frac{5v_0}{7}$$</div>
		<p>We can use basic kinematics again to find the displacement at that time:</p>
		$$x = x_0 + v_0t + \frac{1}{2}at^2$$
		$$x = v_0\left(\frac{2v_0}{7\mu g}\right) -\frac{1}{2}\mu g \left(\frac{2v_0}{7\mu g}\right)^2$$

		<h3>Notes</h3>
		<div class = "footnote">
<p><sup>1</sup> Because our disk is symmetric about the origin and rigid. 
</p>
<p><sup>2</sup> If we want to find the velocity \(v\) of any point <em>relative to the Earth</em>, we can treat the contact point between the object and the ground as our center of rotation. Because it is stationary with respect to the Earth, the velocity \(v_\text{tan}\) of any point relative to it will be the same as the velocity \(v\) of that point relative to the Earth.</p>
