		<h3>Throwing seashells from a cliff</h3>
		<p>You're at the <a href = "http://i.imgur.com/N1NyW.jpg">White Cliffs of Dover</a> with friends. Naturally, a contest is in order: who can throw a seashell the farthest from the base of the cliff?</p>
		<p>"Aim at 45° above the horizon," Wise Will offers somewhat condescendingly. "Maximizes range."</p>
		<p>Do you listen? The 45 does seem familiar, but the stakes are too high for you to rely on memory alone. Calculus to the rescue!</p>
		<img class = "diagram" src = "Projectile motion 1.svg"/>
		<p>If we conveniently neglect drag, we can separate our seashell's motion into \(x\)- and \(y\)-components:</p>
		\begin{align}
		x &= \left(v\cos\theta\right) t \\
		y &= h + \left(v\sin\theta\right) t - \frac{1}{2}gt^2 \\
		\end{align}
		<p>We define our coordinate system such that the seashell lands at a point where \(y = 0\). Even so, we still have too many unknown variables. Rearranging our equation for \(x\) and substituting, however, we can eliminate \(t\).</p>
		\begin{align}
		t &= \frac{x}{v\cos\theta} \\
		0 &= h + v\sin\theta \left(\frac{x}{v\cos\theta}\right) - \frac{1}{2}g\left(\frac{x}{v\cos\theta}\right)^2 \\
		 &= h + x\tan\theta - \frac{gx^2}{2v^2\cos^2\theta} \\
		\end{align}
		<p>Since we're interested in the <em>maximum</em> range, differentiation is a good idea. We are looking for the \(\theta\) that will maximize range, so let's differentiate with respect to \(\theta\)<sup>[1]</sup>.</p>
		$$0 = \tan\theta \frac{dx}{d\theta} + x\sec^2\theta- \frac{g}{2v^2}\left(\frac{2x\cos^2\theta\frac{dx}{d\theta} + 2x^2\sin\theta\cos\theta }{\cos^4\theta}\right)$$
		<p>This looks exceedingly nasty, but since we are searching for a maximum, we know \(\frac{dx}{d\theta} = 0\). Watch the terms disappear!</p>
		\begin{align}
		0 &= x\sec^2\theta - \frac{gx^2\sin\theta\sec^3\theta}{v^2} \\
		x &= \frac{v^2}{g\tan\theta} \\
		\end{align}
		<p>We have stumbled upon the maximum range<sup>[2]</sup>, but not the angle that will grant us this range. We need to back-solve for \(\theta\) using the equation for \(y\) that was in terms of \(x\)<sup>[3]</sup>.</p>
		\begin{align}
		0&= h + \left(\frac{v^2}{g\tan\theta}\right)\tan\theta - \frac{g\left(\frac{v^2}{g\tan\theta}\right)^2}{2v^2\cos^2\theta} \\
		&= h + \frac{v^2}{g} - \frac{v^2}{2g\sin^2\theta} \\
		\end{align}

		<h3>Throwing golden nuggets down a slope</h3>
		
		<p>You have time-traveled to the apex of Khufu's Great Pyramid, whose faces slope at angle \(\beta\) above the horizon. Naturally, another contest is in order: who can throw a golden nugget the farthest down the pyramid?</p> 
		<p>No listening to Will this time—straight to the math!</p>
		<img class = "diagram" src = "Projectile motion 2.svg"/>
		<p>Notice that there are two curves: the slope itself and the parabolic trajectory of the nugget. If we start at the point \((0, h)\), our two curves are</p>
		\begin{align}
			y_\text{slope} &= h - x\tan\beta \\
			y_\text{nugget} &= h + \left(v\sin\alpha\right) t - \frac{1}{2}gt^2 \\
			\end{align}
		<p>In addition, we have the equation for the \(x\)-component of the nugget's motion:</p>
			$$x = \left(v\cos\alpha\right) t$$
		<p>We can immediately eliminate several unknowns, as our first two equations both contain \(y\) and \(h\), while all three contain \(t\). Combining the first two,</p>
			$$-x\tan\beta = \left(v\sin\alpha\right) t - \frac{1}{2}gt^2$$
		<p>Since we are interested in range, having an equation dependent on \(x\) is more useful than having one dependent on \(t\). Similar to our approach in part 1, we can solve for \(t\) using the third equation and then substitute.</p>
		\begin{align}
		t &= \frac{x}{v\cos\alpha} \\
		-x\tan\beta &= v\sin\alpha \left(\frac{x}{v\cos\alpha}\right) - \frac{1}{2}g\left(\frac{x}{v\cos\alpha}\right)^2 \\
		-\tan\beta &= \tan\alpha - \frac{gx}{2v^2\cos^2\alpha} \\
		\end{align}
		<p>Now for differentiation again, this time with respect to \(\alpha\). Remember that we can remove any terms with \(\frac{dx}{d\alpha}\).</p>
		
				\begin{align}
				0 &= \sec^2\alpha - \frac{g}{2v^2}\left(\frac{\cos^2\alpha\frac{dx}{d\alpha} + 2x\sin\alpha\cos\alpha}{\cos^4\alpha}\right) \\
		x &= \frac{v^2}{g\tan\alpha} \\
		\end{align}
		<p>Looks familiar, eh? Let's return to the equation without<sup>[4]</sup> \(h\) and \(t\) to find the corresponding \(\alpha\).</p>
		\begin{align}
		-\tan\beta &= \tan\alpha - \frac{g\left(\frac{v^2}{g\tan\alpha}\right)}{2v^2\cos^2\alpha} \\
		&= \frac{\sin\alpha}{\cos\alpha} - \frac{1}{2\sin\alpha\cos\alpha} \\
		&= \frac{2\sin^2\alpha - 1}{2\sin\alpha\cos\alpha} \\
		\end{align}

		<p>Now, recognizing that \(2\sin\theta\cos\theta = \sin 2\theta\) and \(2\sin^2\theta - 1 = \cos 2\theta\):</p>
		\begin{align}
		-\tan\beta &= -\frac{\cos2\alpha}{\sin2\alpha} = -\cot2\alpha \\
		\alpha &= \frac{\text{arccot}\left(\tan\beta\right)}{2} \\
		\end{align}
		<img class = "diagram" src = "Projectile motion 3.svg"/>
		<p>From right triangle geometry, we can see that \(\text{arccot}\left(\tan\theta\right) = \text{arccot}\left(\frac{o}{a}\right) = \frac{\pi}{2} - \theta\). Therefore,</p>

		<h3>Throwing seashells towards the sky</h3>
		
		<p>Pop quiz! You are standing on level ground in a world without air resistance. Your goal: throw a ball such that the time it spends in the air is maximized. What angle \(\theta\) with respect to the horizon should you choose?</p>
		<ol>
			<li>22.5°</li>
			<li>45°</li>
			<li>60°</li>
			<li>90°</li>
			<li>Depends on the velocity, silly.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Let's see what the math says. Thankfully, in our ideal world, gravity only affects motion in the vertical axis. We can thus say</p>
		$$y = \left(v\sin\theta\right)t - \frac{1}{2}gt^2$$
		<p>When our seashell lands, its height will be 0. Solving for the flight time \(t\) and then differentiating with respect to \(\theta\), we find</p>
		\begin{align}
		t &= \frac{2v\sin\theta}{g} \\
		\frac{dt}{d\theta} &= \frac{2v\cos\theta}{g} = 0 \\
		
		\end{align}
		<div class = "answer">$$\theta = \arccos 0 = \frac{\pi}{2}$$</div>
		<p>Let's make things fancier. What if you are on a cliff of height \(h\)? Relevant equation:</p>
		\begin{align}
		y &= h + \left(v\sin\theta\right) t - \frac{1}{2}gt^2 \\
		0 &= v\left(\left(\cos\theta\right) t + \sin\theta\frac{dt}{d\theta}\right) - gt\frac{dt}{d\theta} \\

		\end{align}
		<p>Perhaps not too surprisingly,</p>
		<div class = "answer">$$\theta = \arccos 0 = \frac{\pi}{2}$$</div>

		<p>What about even fancier. What if you are on a downwards-sloping hill of angle \(\beta\)? This time things are a little more involved.</p>
		\begin{align}
		y_\text{seashell} &= h + \left(v\sin\theta\right) t - \frac{1}{2}gt^2 \\
		y_\text{slope} &= h - x\tan\beta \\
		x &= \left(v\cos\theta\right) t \\
		\end{align}
		<p>Using the techniques we used previously, we can combine our two \(y\) equations and use our \(x\) equation to write any \(x\)s in terms of \(t\):</p>
		\begin{align}
		\left(v\sin\theta\right)t - \frac{1}{2}gt^2 &= - x\tan\beta  \\
		&= - \left(v\cos\theta\right)\left(\tan\beta\right)t  \\
		\end{align}
		<p>Solving for \(t\), we conveniently receive:</p>
		\begin{align}
		t &= \frac{2v}{g}(\sin\theta + \tan\beta\cos\theta) \\
		\frac{dt}{d\theta} &= \frac{2v}{g}(\cos\theta -\tan\beta\sin\theta) = 0 \\
		\theta &= \text{arccot}\left(\tan\beta\right) \\
		\end{align}

	<h3>Notes</h3>
	<div class = "footnote">
		<p>
			<sup>1</sup> We assume that the cliff height \(h\) and our throw speed \(v\) are constant from throw to throw, which makes differentiation with respect to \(\theta\) a lot simpler. 
		</p>
		<p>
			<sup>2</sup> We know our answer must be a maximum because of the geometry of the problem (the projectile travels in a parabola, crossing the \(x\)-axis only once, and the minimum non-negative range intuitively occurs when \(\theta = -\frac{\pi}{2}\)). A more rigorous way to validate the maximum would involve signs analysis or plugging in test values.
			</p> 
				<p>
			<sup>3</sup> We can't use either of the original equations for \(x\) and \(y\) because they are dependent on \(t\), which is still an unknown.
			</p> 
			<p>
				<sup>4</sup> Similar to [3]. Remember, we don't actually know \(h\) when we throw the nugget; we just know there will be a time when both the nugget and slope have traveled a vertical distance \(h\) away from us.
